<h1>
Fight
</h1>

<br/>
Your silence wounds me everywhere.
<br/>
There’s no reasoning with words 
<br/>
that are not there. 
<br/>

<br/>
How can you be so nonchalant?
<br/>
The route we’re on will not
<br/>
accomplish détente. 
<br/>

<br/>
Your sin of omission will only 
<br/>
lead to more distrust.
<br/>
Yell at me, curse at me, strike
<br/>
me if you must. 
<br/>

<br/>
Are we not worth the turbulence 
<br/>
that is our remedy?
<br/>
I’m willing to stand up and fight for 
<br/>
your return to me. 
<br/>
