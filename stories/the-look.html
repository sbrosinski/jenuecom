It’s how you looked at me that drew me in.<br/>
It’s how you moved that caught my eye.<br/>
It’s how you smiled that made me see you.<br/>
And then you spoke.<br/>
And I got lost.<br/>
Carried away by your voice.<br/>
Drowned in your stare.<br/>
Tangled in your smile.<br/>
Elated with every gesture.<br/>
And I was yours.<br/>
And you were mine.<br/>
And we became us.<br/>
All because –<br/><br/>
Of how you looked at me.
