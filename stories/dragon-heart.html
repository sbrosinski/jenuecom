<h1>Dragon Heart</h1>

Gentle dragon, flashes of lightning<br/>
Roll of thunder up high.<br/>
Bring your power.  Bestow your glory.<br/>
Spread your wings as you fly.<br/>
Fiercely ferocious, bleak and atrocious,<br/>
Mountains hide behind your shadow.<br/>
Voice of fire, breath of dire,<br/>
Clouds rumble to your bellow.<br/>
But dear dragon, lovely dragon, <br/>
I hear the sound of your roar.<br/>
Singed with lonely, burnt with sadly,<br/>
Your heart yearns to be adored.  <br/>
