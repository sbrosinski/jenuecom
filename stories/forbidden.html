<h1>
Forbidden
</h1>

<br/>
Why canâ€™t I get you out of my head?
<br/>
Is it because the forbidden fruit is red?
<br/>

<br/>
The symbol for passion and desire
<br/>
share the same shade as dangerous
<br/>
fire.
<br/>

<br/>
What magical spell did you blow on me?
<br/>
Is this really my destiny?
<br/>

<br/>
This hardly fits with my character 
<br/>
to stare into nothingness but see your 
<br/>
face and hear your gentle laughter. 
<br/>

<br/>
Your image is like a misplaced picture.
<br/>
In the wrong book and out of line 
<br/>
yet still as sharp as a dagger. 
<br/>

<br/>
Please take your witchcraft away.
<br/>
I can not and will not be yours
<br/>
tomorrow or today.
