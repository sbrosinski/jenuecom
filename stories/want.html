<h1>
Want 
</h1>

<br/>
It is the most corrupt of the emotions.
<br/>
It will taunt and provoke false notions.
<br/>

<br/>
You'll feel it first in the pupil of your eye.
<br/>
Then it will creep down to contaminate 
<br/>
your heart and make it cry.
<br/>

<br/>
You'll begin to plot for things that you crave.
<br/>
It's an inner terror that will take you to your grave.
<br/>

<br/>
If you can not steal it then it will make you beg.
<br/>
Your mind will be tricked into making the wrong
<br/>
bed.
<br/>

<br/>
It is not jealousy as you might have thought.  
<br/>
It is more brutal, more dangerous, more sought.
<br/>

<br/>
It is the motive in every story; the cause with the 
<br/>
biggest effect.  Its name is quite common so no
<br/>
one will suspect. 
<br/>

<br/>
But it can not fool me I'm pleased to flaunt.
<br/>
The name of the most corrupt emotion is 
<br/>
want.
