The song of my soul began sweetly, "You are my sequoia," but the chorus had a melody that hummed a sad aria.
<br/><br/>
 

Because wanting you doesn't make you vested, needing you doesn't make you present, and loving you is braided 
<br/><br/>
 

With pleads for you to listen, while my voice is hidden by the loud beating sonata.
<br/><br/>
 

But I can't stop singing,
<br/><br/>
 

"You are my sequoia."
