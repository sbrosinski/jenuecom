<h1>
Cat Heaven
</h1>
Is there a cat heaven
<br/>
I think and wonder
<br/>
where great cats go to rest on yonder
<br/>

<br/>
To frolic and play all the day long
<br/>
lay in the sun and day dream on
<br/>

<br/>
You were my best friend
<br/>
you made me smile
<br/>
by cuddling and wiggling all the while
<br/>

<br/>
If there’s a cat heaven that’s where you are 
<br/>
there’s no other more deserving by far
<br/>

<br/>
I’ll miss you Kitty there is no doubt
<br/>
I’ll remember your kindness and
<br/>
talk about
<br/>

<br/>
All the lessons you shared with me
<br/>
to live life jubilantly
<br/>

<br/>
Taking time to enjoy the day
<br/>
to sit down, relax, and play
<br/>

<br/>
Farewell Kitty I’ll miss you so
<br/>
you made a difference I’ll have
<br/>
you know
<br/>

<br/>
Is there a cat heaven?
<br/>
I know there is
<br/>
because that’s where my best
<br/>
friend Kitty is
<br/>

<br/>
