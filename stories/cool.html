Holding a glass of gin, insecurity under his skin. <br/>
Hair over styled.<br/>
Ears tiled with metal <br/>
As warm smoke escape between breaths of <br/>
Brazen coolness.<br/>
Eyes locked onto mine <br/>
Among drinks heâ€™s redefined<br/>
As I mentally untwine the mask of smoothness.<br/>
Ice breaks. Disguise off.  Un-moussed, gin down, <br/>
Earrings off.  <br/>
Blatantly beautiful, intrinsically cool <br/>
Without all the tools, <br/>
Revealing his true sleekness. <br/>
