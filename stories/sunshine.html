<h1>
Sunshine
</h1>

<br/>
I don’t know his name and he 
<br/>
doesn’t know mine but when
<br/>
I’m around him there’s always
<br/>
sunshine.
<br/>

<br/>
He has laughing eyes and a smile to 
<br/>
match but I think it’s his comforting 
<br/>
voice that made me attach. 
<br/>

<br/>
Friendly “hellos” and “how are you today”
<br/>
followed by his trademark smile, that’s
<br/>
his way. 
<br/>

<br/>
When I’m down and feeling blue,
<br/>
I know exactly what to do.
<br/>

<br/>
Reaching out is no trouble at all.
<br/>
He pushes my clouds away   
<br/>
so I don’t fall.
<br/>

<br/>
I don’t know his name and he doesn’t 
<br/>
know mine but I wonder if he knows
<br/>
that he’s my sunshine.  
<br/>
