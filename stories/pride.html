<h1>Pride</h1>

Long ago and far away I asked if my accomplishment would make him proud. The only answer was a door shut in my face. <br/>
I heard a crack. I know he heard it too. And I was left standing, not knowing what to do with my own heart beating in my hands.<br/>
So I withdrew the dagger from my chest and continued on my way, mentally and physically wounded. <br/>
But I did not die. And that made ME proud. <br/>
