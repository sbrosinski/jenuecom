<h1>On Your Birthday </h1>

<br/>
I can’t bake you a cake.
I can’t send you a card.
<br/>

<br/>
I can’t shake your hand or
give you a call.
<br/>

<br/>
All these things are still taboo.
But everything passes and this will too.
<br/>

<br/>
You are a friend; not just an
acquaintance. And there are other ways to convey my sentiments.
<br/>

<br/>
I know who you are. You know who I am.
That's all that matters. What anyone else thinks, I don't give a damn.
<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes the lines of etiquette are blurred,
but I'll still say happy birthday without
feeling absurd.
<br/>

<br/>
So, let me send you the best pieces of me. 
Let me send you warm wishes and 
positive energy. 
<br/>
