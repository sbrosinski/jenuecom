<p>Sometimes my temporomandibular joints hurt. And thereâ€™s really not much I can do about it. My dentist gave me this stupid mouth guard but when I forget to wear it at night my face hurts in the morning. ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>And when thatâ€™s not bothering me, my wisdom teeth hurt. I donâ€™t even have wisdom teeth anymore!!! ðŸ¤¯  So why do I feel like my wisdom teeth hurt? Iâ€™m not telling my dentist because sheâ€™ll just think Iâ€™m crazy.</p>
<p>I have the weirdest dental problems. Â¯_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>
