		<h1>Jenue</h1>
        <p> Former junior accountant turned Java code connoisseur. I like writing short stories and poetry when the feeling hits me. I love all things sweet! Tea is my drink of choice. I used to drink coffee disguised heavily with lactose free milk and sugar, but I deleted coffee and dairy from my diet. I’ve been told that my personality matches my sweet tooth. I’m, however, somewhat socially awkward and weird. I love learning languages. I’m a native English speaker, fairly fluent in German, and proficient in reading Portuguese. I'm currently studying Romanian. My demeanor is soft spoken but I'm incredibly bold in spirit. I love using the word love and I'm all about flower power. I enjoy being open-minded, approachable, and playful. Stay a while and vibe with me! <br/><br/>
