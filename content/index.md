		<h1>Jenue</h1>
        <p> Former junior accountant turned Java code monkey. I still like writing short stories and poetry when the feeling hits me. I love all things sweet! Tea is my drink of choice. I only drink coffee if it’s disguised heavily with milk and sugar. I’m a very nice person. I’ve been told that my personality matches my sweet tooth. I’m, however, somewhat socially awkward and weird. I used to like traveling but Covid stole that from me. I love learning languages. I’m a native English speaker, fairly fluent in German, proficient in Portuguese, and have a newfound affinity for Romanian. I’m soft spoken but extremely bold in spirit. I love to love! I’m open minded, playful and approachable. <br/><br/>
