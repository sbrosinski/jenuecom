Mongoose took a negative covid test yesterday. The rest of us are still healthy. Mongoose was quarantined. We wore masks and washed our hands often. That was enough to prevent the virus from spreading. 

 Most people don’t test for covid anymore since the pandemic is officially over. Chances are the rest of us will get covid before the end of winter. 

There are a lot of other mean viruses that might feel even worse than covid. Last year Flamingo got covid and breezed through it in about 3 days with very little symptoms. Then a few weeks later Flamingo got something else, and it was way worse than covid. It lasted for two weeks with symptoms of high fever, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue and all the usual flu symptoms.

I hate winter because it’s cold, miserable, and someone is always sick. Winter always feels never-ending, but someone pointed out that winter is exactly 3 months long. And all the other seasons are also 3 months long. I never realized that.

But I still hate winter!
