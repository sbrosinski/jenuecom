title: No Man is an Island by John Donne
date: "2024-12-06"

No man is an island, <br>
Entire of itself; <br>
Every man is a piece of the continent, <br>
A part of the main.

If a clod be washed away by the sea, <br>
Europe is the less, <br>
As well as if a promontory were: <br>
As well as if a manor of thy friend's <br>
Or of thine own were.

Any man's death diminishes me,<br>
Because I am involved in mankind.<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; <br>
It tolls for thee.

*This is one of my favorite poems. I, of course, like everyone else strive to be as independent as possible. This poem reminds us that no one is truly self-sufficient; everyone relies on others in some way, shape or form.*
