Studying today feels like a déjà vu. I’ve done this before!  The first time I went to university I majored in Business and minored in Management Information Systems. So, I took a lot of computer science classes. I graduated in ´98.

And now 1000 years later 😵‍💫 I’m right back where I started. Standing on the threshold of a German University. I have mixed feelings about having to start over. But the circumstances are different. Different country. Different language. Different time period. New adventure! And I welcome the 2nd chance.

When life throws you lemons just add some sugar and water and enjoy the lemonade.
