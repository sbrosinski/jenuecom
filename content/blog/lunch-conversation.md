I’m mostly on time. In fact, I’m usually ten minutes early to my appointments. But I’ve noticed that for some people being “on time” is directly related to how far they live from their destination.

The closer they live to their place of employment or school, the more likely it is that they’re late. It’s a little counterintuitive, but I think I understand the reasoning behind it.

When you live close to your destination, you think you have more time than you actually do, and this results in habitual tardiness.

Have you noticed this with your peers or even yourself? Does this phenomenon have a name? 🤔
