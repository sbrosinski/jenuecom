I’ve come to the realization that being happy isn’t about having everything I want.  I most definitely don’t have everything that I want. In some ways, I’m lacking considerably. But I have most of the things that I need, and I’m exceedingly thankful for them.

Of course, I’m working on what’s lacking in my life. But that doesn’t mean that I can’t claim happiness. There’s so much to be happy about. There’s so much to be thankful for. And it’s completely up to me to enjoy the little things that make life pleasant.

A happy state of mind is really all that’s needed to be happy. But you know what? I have a little more than that! And I think most people do, they just don’t see it.

Count your blessings and claim your happiness!
