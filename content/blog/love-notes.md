Today is a rainy day with rolling thunder and lightning. ⛈️ It’s supposed to rain the whole day, but I don’t mind. It’s relaxing and peaceful.

I feel so light since I passed the B1. The stress of the individual tests really weighed me down. The looming made me miserable. I’m still waiting for the results of the einbürgerungstest, but compared to the B1, it was fairly effortless. And even if I failed by some weird misfortune, retaking it won’t be a big deal.

So right now, I’m just enjoying the rest of my summer. This storm is beautiful. It’s an orchestra of thunder and lightning with interludes of raindrops on my windowpane. And at this very moment I’m typing this blog post while listening to Love Notes by Damien Escobar. 🎻
