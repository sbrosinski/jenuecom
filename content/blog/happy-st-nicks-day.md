In my family St. Nick’s Day is special. And I would like to extend my cheer to all of you. May your hearts be filled with joy and warmth during this cold winter season. 

I know that the holidays can be sad, stressful, and difficult. If you’re having a hard time right now just remember:

Everything passes

Keep breathing

Someone loves you (and you might not even know it)

You’re made of stardust!
