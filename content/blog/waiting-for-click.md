title: Waiting for My Click

I hear many people say that learning Java takes a lot of practice and you have to wait for something in your head to click before you really understand it. 

Well, I’m still waiting for my click. Oh my gosh, where’s my click? I’m not really panicking yet, but I would, at least, like to write basic code without struggling so much. 

I really need my click to happen by the end of this year. Maybe I need to change the way I’m learning? I’m not sure what it is, but I’m going to find the problem, fix it, and get my click.
