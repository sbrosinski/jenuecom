I literally woke up this morning with the sun on my face. I was happy to be awake, but slightly sad to have left a beautiful dream. What is the opposite of a nightmare? Is there a word for that? My subconscious gave me exactly what I wanted, what I craved, what Iâ€™ve been fantasizing about, in the form of a dream. And I remember every detail of it. 

I am very thankful and happy for this gift. I hope the dream visits me again soon, but until then Iâ€™ll enjoy the sunshine. Itâ€™s such a beautiful day today. And I know that this is also a gift. ðŸŒž
