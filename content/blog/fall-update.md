I havenâ€™t written anything in a long while. My last blog post was about my clogged ears.  Well, the nose spray didnâ€™t work, and the nose balloon was a useless thing. I didnâ€™t go back to the doctor because I think my ears, eventually, healed themselves. They still get that clogged feeling once in a while, but Iâ€™ve gotten used to it.

The month of September was unusually warm. And that warmth spilt over into October. I enjoyed it! The weather has started to change into cooler fall temperatures and grey skies. I donâ€™t mind the cool weather, but the many consecutive days without sunlight tears at my soul. The long winter journey begins!

I canâ€™t believe that Christmas is only a few weeks away. This year flew by at the speed of light. Iâ€™m sad to say that I donâ€™t have any new accomplishments to record. But I remain hopeful that the new year will bring both opportunity and health.

In the meantime, Happy Halloween ðŸŽƒ ðŸ‘»
