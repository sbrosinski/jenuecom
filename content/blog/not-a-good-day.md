Today someone broke something, blamed me for it, and ridiculed me as I tried my best to fix it. We resolved the situation, but I didnâ€™t like how I was treated. Then when I confronted him about it, all he had to say was, "I was stressed." 

So I have to take your verbal abuse because you were stressed?
