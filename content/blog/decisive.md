I’m usually a very decisive person, but like all people I have my indecisive moments. On these occasions I just ask myself, “if I’m going to die tomorrow…” 

If I’m going to die tomorrow, what would I like for lunch?

If I’m going to die tomorrow, should finish reading this book?

If I’m going to die tomorrow, should I clean my apartment?

If I’m going to die tomorrow, should I cut my hair?

It’s amazing how “if I’m going to die tomorrow” will show you what you really want and need. So if you’re having a moment of indecisiveness just use this little prompt. 😉
