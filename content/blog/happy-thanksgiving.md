Happy Thanksgiving to all of you who celebrate it. I live in Europe so todayâ€™s just a normal workday for me. When I lived in the United States my Caribbean family celebrated with traditional Caribbean food.  

My mother used to get all her ingredients from a little Asian shop on Old World 3rd Street. The shop owner, a sweet little ancient and wise man, always had everything we needed. He even had canned ackee and Cock flavored soup mix. And for those of you who donâ€™t know, stop laughing, itâ€™s not what you think. Just google it!

Anywho, donâ€™t forget to be thankful and create lots of good memories. Try to enjoy the little annoyances because someday youâ€™ll look back and realize that these were the good ole days. 

Be the sunshine. ðŸ¦ƒ  Happy Thanksgiving! ðŸ¦ƒ
