I would like to only blog about happiness and sunshine but life isnâ€™t always like that, is it?  So, today Iâ€™m going to be real with you. My soul feels like itâ€™s on fire. Iâ€™m tired of being disappointed. Iâ€™m tired of feeling alone and invisible. ðŸ’” But I still have hope that tomorrow will be better. Send hugs!
