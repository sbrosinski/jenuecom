Wishing everyone a fun 4th of July! 🇺🇸  It's been raining on and off all day in my city, so I decided not to BBQ. But I'm still having traditional American food for dinner. Can you guess what that is? 

And I can't end this post without some solidarity for Jamaica in regard to Hurricane Beryl. Big up! We always recover. One Love ♥️
