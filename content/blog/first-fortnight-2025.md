I wasn’t sure if I was going to continue blogging this year, but why not?

2025 began with heaps of paperwork.  I have a feeling that this year is going to be all about paperwork.  I’m still knee-deep in documents, and I’m currently waiting for more documents so I can process those.  It seems never ending!

The other day, I saw Flamingo open the fridge door and somehow hit herself in the face with the fridge door.  Oh my gosh, how do you hit yourself in the face with the fridge door? She hurt her nose a little, but it wasn’t broken or anything. Thank goodness for that, because how in the world would I explain that to a doctor.  S/he would think that I’m lying. Heck, if someone told me that story, I would also think they're lying.

I still have my Christmas tree up. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Winter is in full force. It snow-rained a few days ago and the streets were icy. I’ve never been the kind of person to look at snow and say, “Oh how beautiful.”  Sure, if you don’t have to drive in it, walk in it, or shovel it, then it’s beautiful.

I would say that so far, the year has started well. I’m looking forward to the progression, the projects, and of course, the shenanigans. 😁 ❤︎
