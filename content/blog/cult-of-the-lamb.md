A lamb was saved by a mysterious stranger and now must repay his debt by starting a cult with loyal woodland followers who worship “the one who waits.”  He ventures out into regions of monsters to earn items and new followers for his cult.

He has to take care of his cult members basic needs, or they will die. Make sure they don’t lose faith. Take care of his village, and sometimes even make sacrifices. 

This game can get delightfully evil. Give it a go!
