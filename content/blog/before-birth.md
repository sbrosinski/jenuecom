Is there a word for the place that stores the souls/people that will be born?  I know this is a weird question. But I hear children talk about this place all the time.  They would ask, “Mommy, where was I before I was in your tummy?” And then they are really confused when their parents tell them that they were not in existence yet. 

I’ve pondered this question and haven’t found an answer. Religion offers no clue as to where souls or people are kept before conception. It only talks about death. But if there’s a place for people who are no longer alive... Shouldn’t there also be a place for people or souls who are not yet born? 

I think the children are right! Where is this place? What is this place? And why don’t we know about it?
