I was playing animal crossing with friends and Kapp'n sang,

“Don’t cry about dreams that don’t come true. Sometimes you just need another way.”

And Oh my gosh, that line really resonates with me right now. This might sound silly, because it’s just a game, but I'm inspired by it. ✨

My Island's name is maoland 

DA-3535-0060-0852

I share this island with my family. I'm BlueBird. The house with the red roof, Red Coral Resort, is mine.

Watch out for the pitfall field! 😂
