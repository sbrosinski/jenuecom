title: Details Matter

In all fields of life details matter. People notice the little things. And itâ€™s often the smallest details that make an otherwise mediocre work into something of excellence. 

Itâ€™s really amazing how the smallest details can make a colossal difference. A hand placed on a shoulder can provide comfort. A smile can be encouraging. A thank you can change how people see you. 

An extra line of code to properly document your work will be greatly appreciated, even if no one seems to care. 

When accepting gifts people notice the wrapping. They will appreciate the hand stitched monogram and homemade items.  And even if they donâ€™t like the actual gift, they will love that you made the extra effort. 

Paying attention to detail can make a good dinner into a special one. The examples can go on forever. But Iâ€™ll end this post here. I love a good detail! ðŸ¤“
