I like going to concerts, the symphony, and the theater.  I would also like to go to a cosplay convention someday. I was shopping for exciting outings and found a few musicians that I’d really like to see. But, unfortunately, I had to say no to some of them because their venue only had standing spaces.

I am short and a little ochlophobic.  Just the thought of so many people standing next to me, in front of me, and behind me makes me feel trapped. Not only would I not be able to see anything, I would probably faint.

I would have really liked to see Dogstar and watch Keanu Reeves play guitar.  Kesha would have been a great girl’s night out! But I can’t imagine myself standing in a pit of people.  I know I’m not the only one who feels this way.

The bottom line is you guys are losing money! You would get a lot more people at your concerts if you paid for a better venue.  For me, being near the exit and having a place to sit really helps with ochlophobia. It gives a small square of personal space at crowded events that would otherwise feel threatening.
