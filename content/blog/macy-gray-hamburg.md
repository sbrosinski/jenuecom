The Macy Gray concert didn’t disappoint. There were two opening bands, Terra Renae and Miu.  Both bands were entertaining, but we were all waiting patiently, in uncomfortable seats, for Macy.  

Macy was magnificent. Her band was marvelous. And Mayaeni, the lady guitarist and singer was a rockstar in her own right. The audience appropriately gasped and cheered as she debuted her solo.

This concert paid tribute to Macy Gray’s 25th anniversary. She’s like fine wine. Age just made her even more amazing!
