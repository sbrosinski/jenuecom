title: Break Free

I re-read the poem that I wrote yesterday and decided to change the title from “Crazy” to “Break Free.”  “Break Free” captures the overall theme of the poem a little better than “Crazy.”  In a nutshell, this poem is about the struggle of breaking free from crazy.

It’s not a rhyming poem, but it flows very nicely and I’m really proud of it. I’m a bit arrogant in thinking that if I like it, others will like it too. So, I’m going to hold on to this piece for a while and not post it on my website. I think it has a good chance of actually being published, and I’m going to give it that chance.

On a different topic, since 2024 began, I started writing in a private journal recording my daily activities, feelings, food etc. I take a few minutes to write in my journal before bed, and this one little change in my daily life is unbelievably fulfilling. I’m not sure why, but I’ve become more motivated, focused, and productive.

If you’re having trouble with motivation, I highly recommend starting a private journal.

This blog is also like a journal, but it’s public and I, of course, don’t write personal things here. That would be crazy! 😉
