I donâ€™t know how to delete a course on Duolingo once itâ€™s added. I have German, Portuguese, French, and Romanian. 

I donâ€™t speak French at all. I added the course because I was curious and then decided it wasnâ€™t for me. I donâ€™t like that in French the words arenâ€™t written like they sound.  

I donâ€™t speak Romanian either. I do, however, love this language. The structure is quite unique, and the sound of the language is so welcoming that itâ€™s fun to learn. I unfortunately donâ€™t have the time right now to invest in a new language. 

I speak German. My grammar is not the best, but I can understand 95% of Hoch Deutsch and I can speak fluently enough to be understood. 

I understand simple Portuguese. I think that I can speak enough to get by, and I can read Portuguese very well. 

I spent years in High School and College learning Spanish, but I donâ€™t remember any of it. If I have time someday, maybe Iâ€™ll revisit this language. 

So in all transparency, that's what's up on my Duolingo! ðŸ˜‰ 

I must also say that if youâ€™re really adamant on becoming fluent in a language Duolingo will not be enough. You will need a few other resources to achieve fluency.
