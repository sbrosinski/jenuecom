Today is Saturday and it’s raining the whole day, but the cool rain is a nice break from the many consecutive days of hot weather that we’ve been getting.

This summer started with unusual desert-like heat. I love summer and warm weather, but it’s been uncomfortably hot. It’s good to feel the rain on my face!
