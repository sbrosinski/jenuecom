title: You are not ugly

Yesterday I clicked on the saddest video in my youtube feed.  The title was, “What’s a clear sign that you are unattractive?”  Oh boy!  All the comments were hella heartbreaking.

Listen, I have always been the plain Jane.  I am not in any way, shape or form the trending beautiful woman.  The keyword here is trending.  People are attracted to me for other reasons.  Maybe they like the fact that I don’t look like everyone else. Or they like how confident I am in my own skin.  I have never felt ugly in my entire life, yet I don’t fit the beauty standards.  I am uniquely me, and a lot of people like that about me.

I have never wanted the kind of attention that physical beauty attracts.  I’m more concerned that people like me because I’m friendly, competent, and peaceful. I would be so hurt if someone calls me mean.  And I probably shouldn’t be telling you that because now you know how to get under my skin. 😅

I’m genuinely unbothered if someone calls me ugly. And, you know, you should be too. When people can’t insult anything else about you, they insult your looks.

Be uniquely you and others will love you for it. ❤︎
