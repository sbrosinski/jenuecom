Today is -5° C outside and for some reason there’s no hot water in my apartment. I had to use hot water from my teapot to brush my teeth this morning.

I’m really trying to stay cheerful, but winter is especially miserable this year. Even though I adore the Christmas season, I really would rather be somewhere on the equator taking a walk on the beach. Drinking a rum punch. And watching the sunset at the end of the day.
