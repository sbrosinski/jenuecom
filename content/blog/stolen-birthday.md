I don’t know anyone who appreciates daylight savings time.  Today the clocks jumped ahead one hour.  It’s crazy how that one missing hour messes with your head.  Everything just feels a little off.

Can we please stop with this silly tradition? Flamingo’s birthday was changed by daylight savings time.  On the day she was born the clocks fell back one hour.  She would have arrived at midnight 12:17, but unfortunately the clocks were altered that day and it was 11:17 pm.

She and her great-grandmother would have had the same birthday! I remember Uroma eagerly waiting for her arrival and was super excited about sharing a birthday. 

We really dislike daylight savings time.
