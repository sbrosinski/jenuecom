There was a death in the family, so I called Goose because I wanted to be supportive. Instant regret!

 Goose and I will always clash. I broke my own rule for the sake of family, but some bridges really need to stay burned.  Why the heck would she lie about getting my package?

In a nutshell, I sent her a religious amber and turquoise beaded bracelet, along with a religious icon. She claimed that she didn't get the package. But then, out of the blue, she starts talking about a "random" beaded bracelet even though I never told her what was inside the package. 

Hmmâ€¦ sounds like deceit. Why lie though? ðŸ¤¥
