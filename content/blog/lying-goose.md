There was a death in the family, so I called Goose because I wanted to be supportive. Instant regret!

 Goose and I will always clash. I broke my own rule for the sake of family, but some bridges really need to stay burned.  Why the heck would she lie about getting my package?

In a nutshell, I sent her a religious beaded bracelet and an icon which she claimed she didn't receive. I never told her what was inside the package, but then she starts talking about a "random" beaded bracelet.

Hmmâ€¦ smells dishonest. ðŸ¤¥ Why lie though?
