I get a lot of spam emails and sometimes they get into my inbox. This one is funny! So apparently my name is Peter. And Peter is getting a shipping confirmation from Amazon. The way this is written is hilarious. I literally laughed out loud! 

Peter bought a Magnetic Locator. What the 🤐 is that?

He spent $569,00. 

And the last few sentences were really funny: “Thanks a lot for your order. You made a nice choice!”

And in fine print is written, “Your order will be with you shortly. Go ahead and clear off some shelf space.”  

Thank you for sending me this silly email. I needed the laugh. 🤣
