Today is the 4-year anniversary of the removal of my last wisdom tooth. I had a hard time waking up after the surgery and had to spend the next five days in the heart station. It was a traumatic time for me, so every year since then I’ve been silently celebrating March 8th as the day I lived.  Is that weird?

I live next to an apartment building where predominately elderly people live. Today I watched as they carried yet another dead body out of building 8, on March 8th.  I’m starting to think that 8 is an unlucky number. 

A mighty thank you to the dental surgeon for removing that awful tooth without breaking my jaw while somehow managing to evade nerve damage. You will always be awesome in my memory.
