On my commute today I saw a blind lady walking down the stairs to the train. I was walking the same direction. When she got down the bottom of the stairs a little boy took her hand. He looked at me for a second and smiled. He was not blind. Then he went to the man standing directly behind his mother, who was also blind, and he guided his father’s right hand onto his mother’s shoulder.

I watched, in amazement, as he led his family into the train. I would guess that the little boy is only about seven years old. And judging from his backpack, he was on his way to school.

Oh wow, imagine if both your parents are blind. It’s inspiring how they take care of each other.

Seeing this makes all of my problems seem insignificant. If you're reading this, I wish you a wonderful day. Be amazing!
