Gift Giving

I love giving gifts! And the gift giving season is indeed upon us. If I give you a gift itâ€™s because I love you, or I want to say thank you, or both. You will, hopefully, know why. ðŸ˜‰

But as much as I love giving gifts, Iâ€™m also very cautious about doing so. The whole gift giving process can get a little political. For example, what is an expensive gift? What is a cheap gift? 
I think you know where Iâ€™m going with this post. Whatâ€™s expensive for one person, may not be expensive for the other. And you might not share my opinion about whatâ€™s cheap. As a rule, if you are not close friends, a gift should fall in between expensive and cheap. But that can be a little tricky. 

For example, good perfume is always expensive. But I could never give an adult cheap perfume. Iâ€™d rather not give anything at all. The same concept goes for jewelry. I mean, why would I give someone that I like something that will turn their hand green? I wonâ€™t!  So, what do I do? If Iâ€™m not allowed to give a person an expensive gift, then I stay away from perfume and jewelry. 

Giving someone a ridiculously cheap gift is always a big NO for me. But there are many times when giving expensive gifts is inappropriate. For example, giving an expensive gift to your childâ€™s teacherâ€¦ BIG NO for obvious reasons. Also, giving expensive gifts to those who might feel obligated to give you a gift in return is a no. 

With all this said, here is a list of gifts that I like to give:

* Notebooks or journals
* Scarfs and gloves
* Chocolates
* A nice pen
* Unisex beaded bracelets 
* Homemade jar of cookies
* Gift baskets: Food or Cosmetics
* Bath bombs or salts
* A nice silver brooch (for women) 
* Silver cufflinks or tie pins (for men)
* Blankets
* Fancy coffees and Teas 
* Coffee or tea mugs

Gifts that I love getting:
* Hugs and Kisses ðŸ¥°
* Compliments (Yes, please flatter me) ðŸ˜…
* Chocolates
* Socks (Because I always have holes in mine)
* Home-baked goods
* Keepsakes (like Christmas ornaments)
* Gift baskets
