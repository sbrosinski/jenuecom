I think someone wants to say something to me but is reluctant to contact me directly. If I know you, I will answer your email. And I often answer emails just to acknowledge that itâ€™s been read. Iâ€™m very polite and I try to be friendly, so please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me (directly).

Youâ€™re welcome to my inbox! ðŸ˜‰
