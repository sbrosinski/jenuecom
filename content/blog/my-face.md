Sometimes my temporomandibular joints hurt. And there’s really not much I can do about it. My dentist gave me this stupid mouth guard but when I forget to wear it at night my face hurts in the morning. 😭 

And when that’s not bothering me, my wisdom teeth hurt. I don’t even have wisdom teeth anymore!!! 🤯  So why do I feel like my wisdom teeth hurt? I’m not telling my dentist because she’ll just think I’m crazy. 

I have the weirdest dental problems. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
