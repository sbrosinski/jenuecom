Thank you, Bear for the gift of this beautiful book. Today is a special day and this proves that you know me very well. Anyone who knows me, knows that I'm a little spooky, and I think I can credit my love of Poe for my spooky ways. ❤︎

I'm looking forward to spending some cozy moments with this book!
