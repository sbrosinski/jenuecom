title: New Year’s Resolution 2024
date: "2023-12-22"

My only wish for 2024 is that I’m healthy again.  I spent most of 2023 feeling generally unwell. And this, of course, affected my ability to live and work properly.  My family literally carried me through this year. I’m so fortunate to be surrounded by people who take care of me. I love you guys! ️🥰

My biggest accomplishment this year (2023) is that I tied up my loose ends. I was thinking that I might not survive the year, so I told the people that are important to me how I feel about them. Maybe I was being dramatic, but I don’t regret my decision. And being open and honest about my feelings to people that matter is something that I will continue doing.

I have so much catching up to do in 2024 that it’s not necessary to make a new resolution. I have a lot to do!
