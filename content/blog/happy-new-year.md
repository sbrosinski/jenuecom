This year has definitely been a roller coaster ride for me. At one point, I honestly didn’t think I would see 2022, so I’m really thankful to be here. I’m curious to see what the future holds and prepared for the new adventure. 

To those of you who walked with me in 2021, I love you and wish you a Happy New Year!
