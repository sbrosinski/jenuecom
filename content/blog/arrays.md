Today Iâ€™m practicing arrays and references. Pretty basic stuff! But you have to learn how to crawl before you can run. 

Also, this is important so pay attention: Don't even think about trying to learn coding without an IDE! You can install a free version of IntelliJ. You can not learn how to code by just reading a book.
