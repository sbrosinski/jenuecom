Verschlimmbessert is my new favorite German word! It means, when you try to make something better but end up making it worse. Yes, one word means all of that. And itâ€™s a perfect example of German efficiency. 

Iâ€™m wondering why Iâ€™ve never heard this word before, but I will be using it very often from now on. ðŸ˜‰
