I’m really struggling with this assignment. Which brings me to my tip of the day:

**Ask for help!**

A lot of people are afraid to ask for help. Don’t be! 

Ask the right questions.  

Ask for directions to help you solve your project. Don’t expect another developer to do your job for you. There’s a big difference. 

Also, if one person can’t or won’t help you, ask someone else. And don’t be afraid to be just a little bit annoying. Someone will help you. CS is about team work!
