Oh my gosh, I still can’t believe that it’s already 3rd Advent. I blinked and this year was over! My Christmas tree and other decorations are up. All the gifts are wrapped and waiting proudly underneath the tree. And Alexa has been playing Christmas songs.  I even sing along sometimes, and my family makes fun of me because I sing like a frog. It’s all in good fun of course.

I was a little sad that I fell short of this year’s resolution, but then I realized that I made progress in other areas of my life. And you know, I’m happy with that.

My Christmas wish is that my family and friends are happy, healthy and prosperous. ❤︎ 

Until next blog post – Be well 🧸
