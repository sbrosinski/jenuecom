This morning my doorbell rang at about 7 a.m.  I’m still asleep because it’s Saturday, but I’m expecting packages, so I quickly roll out of bed and open the door. When the delivery guy said, “I have a package for your neighbor,” I almost cursed him out. Oh, my goodness, why! 

And when my neighbor picked up his package, he said that the delivery person never rang his doorbell.. 🙄
