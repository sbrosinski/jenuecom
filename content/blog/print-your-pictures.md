Real photo albums have a big advantage over digital photo albums simply because they are easily accessible to everyone, not just you.

The other day a friend was visiting. She wanted to see pictures of an event, but at that moment I didn’t have access to them. They were safely saved somewhere online, and I couldn’t remember the password.

After my guest left, I recovered my pictures! But losing digital pictures probably happen more often than it should. What if someone dies and s/he is the only one who knows where the pictures are saved? And even if you figure out where the pictures are, how will you know the password?

In our digital world it might seem old-fashioned and backwards, but printing special occasion pictures is extremely important.
