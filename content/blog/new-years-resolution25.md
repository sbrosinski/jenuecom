title: New Year's Resolution 2025

I wanted to write one poem and one short story this year, but I failed to write a short story and there’s only 3 weeks left until this year is over.  I looked back on all the stories that I’ve written and realized that I’ve never tried writing a story targeted for children, or kid’s book.

If I attempt such a project, I think I would like to include illustrations. And the best artist that I know is Flamingo.  I wonder if I can convince her to draw a few illustrations for me.  I know that her first instinct will be to say no thank you. 😂

So, I guess this is one of my goals for 2025.  Write a kid’s book, complete with illustrations.  I also have a crap load of administrative stuff to get done from my to-do list.  I have no big plans for 2025. My New Year’s resolution is just doing more of what I like doing.

Happy St. Nick’s Day! 🎅 Was there chocolate in your shoe? 🍫
