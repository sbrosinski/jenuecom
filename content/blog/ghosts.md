I think Iâ€™m going bonkers because it seems like Youtube is sending me subliminal messages. Like, as I scroll through my feed, I see video titles that actually make a sentence and is relevant to me.

First of all, how? And other strange things have been happening with my electric devices. Sometimes while Iâ€™m watching a video on my laptop, the video slides away, so I can see my desktop and then slides back to the video â€“ All by itself!

Today my TV went to the menu, clicked around for a bit, and went back to what I was watching â€“ All by itself.

Ghosts?! No, I donâ€™t think so. I believe in ghosts, but I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m being spooked. A more likely explanation is that someone has access to our ethernet. So, if someone wants to talk to me please just email, call, or text.

I don't speak Ghosts ðŸ‘» ðŸ˜‰
