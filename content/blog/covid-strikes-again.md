Flamingo has been sick for 3 days now. It’s only a matter of time before the rest of us also get covid. But this year, I’m not so worried about it. We had it before, so I know that we’ll be fine.

Other than that, there’s really not much to update. Life’s been pretty basic and redundant this year. I’m not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, boring is good. But on the other hand, a little adventure could have added more fun, more value, and better memories.

Taking it easy has improved my health. I certainly feel better than I did last year.  I can’t say that I’m 100% yet, but I’ve been having more good days than bad days. I think most of my problems have been revolving around digestive problems. The doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with me. I’ve been really careful with what I eat and drink, and I’m starting to really feel better. With God’s grace, maybe I’ll heal to 100%.

I’m having trouble believing that Christmas is in a few weeks. I’m not really in the Christmas spirit right now. Most of my Christmas shopping is done, but shopping was more a chore than a joy. I love giving gifts though! But this year feels somehow incomplete. Like I forgot to do something. And now it’s over. 😐 It's slightly more bitter than sweet.
