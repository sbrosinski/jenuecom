Just about everyone I know is sick. Most people arenâ€™t checking for covid anymore, so Iâ€™m not sure what they have. There are a lot of children in the hospital with the RS virus.

Iâ€™m also not feeling well. I have a strange tummy illness that prevents me from eating. And Iâ€™m feeling generally unwell â€“ tired and lethargic.

Get well wishes to everyone! Let the light, love and spirit of Christmas be healing.  ðŸ•¯ðŸŒŸ
