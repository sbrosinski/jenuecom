I was unfortunately not able to attend this class. Iâ€™m struggling with some health problems at the moment.  Iâ€™ll wait a week to see if it goes away by itself before making a doctorâ€™s appointment. I have absolutely no faith in my general practitioner. Finding a good doctor is so difficult!

My German lesson will have to wait until I feel better. Hopefully I feel better soon because I really do feel like crap. ðŸ¤’
