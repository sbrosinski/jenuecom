This is Hero! He’s one year old. He’s my friend’s dog. His paws smell like popcorn. Don’t ask! I know it’s weird, but his paws smell like popcorn.

Hero only understands Polish. He speaks dog! But with a Polish accent. Anywho, Hero likes to destroy his toys. He also likes to run around and play with random deflated footballs at the park.

He's the best boy!
