title: Passed the B1

I retook the B1 German test and passed with a score of 81/100. This means that I have officially completed the German B1. I am over the moon!

I swear that the guy overseeing this test was the doppelgÃ¤nger of someone I know. He even sounded like him. Dressed like him. Same smile. I wanted to know his name, but he unfortunately didnâ€™t introduce himself and I didnâ€™t feel like it was appropriate to ask. He gave me this weird and wonderful feeling of dÃ©jÃ -vu.

Even if there's only a modicum of probability that he reads this post, I still want to say thank you. ğŸŒ»
