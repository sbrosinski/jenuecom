Oh my! I havenâ€™t posted anything for weeks. This year has been quite a struggle, so my attention was pulled elsewhere. Iâ€™m hoping for better days with the coming of Spring. Iâ€™d like to wish everyone that I hold dear to my heart a Happy Easter. Let's remember the true meaning behind this holiday.

I know a lot of you have Spring allergies, but we can still appreciate the beautiful flowers and the promise of Summer. I'm looking forward to more sunshine and warmer weather. ðŸŒ» ðŸ¦‹ ðŸŒž

Blessings to all of you!
