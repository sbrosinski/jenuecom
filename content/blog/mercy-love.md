Iâ€™m not sure that I should be documenting this, but Iâ€™ve been stuck wondering if itâ€™s ever okay to say I love you to someone who you donâ€™t really love.

You see, I have a very turbulent relationship with my mom. But the other day, I reached out to her because she had some documents that I needed. Anyway, at the end of our conversation she said, I love you. 

Which she knows, damn well, that I donâ€™t! I was annoyed about it.  But in that moment, I thought it was just best to reciprocate her words.  So, I said I love you back. 

And I have been regretting it ever since. It makes me feel like a liar.  Because I am.  

Sheâ€™s old. Someday she will die. And I though that if it makes her happy, just say it back to her.  

I donâ€™t hate her.  And I certainly donâ€™t wish her any harm. But I have a long list of reasons why I donâ€™t love her.  

And now that I had some time to reflect, when she dies it wonâ€™t change my feelings for her. I will still remember her as she was. The death of a person wonâ€™t induce love for them. 

Iâ€™m mad at myself. ðŸ˜” As Iâ€™m writing this blog post, I realize that mercy is not a good enough reason to say, I love you.
