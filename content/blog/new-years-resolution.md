title: My New Year's Resolution
date: "2021-12-07"

I spend so much time chasing unattainable rainbows that Iâ€™ve been missing out on enjoying the stars that Iâ€™ve caught. I usually donâ€™t make new yearâ€™s resolutions but this year Iâ€™ll make an exception.  So here goesâ€¦ Iâ€™m officially declaring my New Yearâ€™s resolution:

I will make my best effort to spend more time in the moment, appreciating and enjoying what I have.

Now that it is written, it shall be done! ðŸ˜‚

Iâ€™ll still be chasing rainbows and butterflies! Because thatâ€™s who I am. But if I can spend more time in the moment and less time chasing, Iâ€™ve already won. 

Do you have a New Yearâ€™s resolution?
