I’m tired of hearing people say love hurts. No, it doesn’t! It’s not love that hurt you. 

The idea that love hurts is very dangerous. Don’t let anyone hurt you! 

Love alone is not enough to sustain a healthy relationship. You need compatibility, financial security, tolerance, will power, and the ability to sacrifice. 

Sharing your life with someone is very difficult. But please don’t equate hurting with love.

 This Bilbe verse tells us what love is.

New International Version <br/>
1 Corinthians 13:4-7 <br/>
4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Nowhere in that verse does it say, love hurts.
