I’m tired of hearing people say love hurts. No, it doesn’t!

It’s not love that hurt you. What hurt you is most likely your fear of losing love.

I wouldn’t describe myself as religious. But I grew up in a Lutheran church. I studied the bible. This verse tells us what love is.

1 Corinthians 13:4-7
New International Version
4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Nowhere in that verse does it say, love hurts.

People think that (romantic) love alone is enough to sustain a relationship, but it’s not. You need compatibility, financial security, tolerance, will power, and the ability to sacrifice.

Sharing your life with someone is very difficult. But please don’t equate hurting with love. Believing that “love hurts” is very dangerous. Don’t let anyone hurt you!
