title: Love is...

Iâ€™m tired of hearing people say love hurts. No, it doesnâ€™t! Itâ€™s not love that hurt you. 

The idea that love hurts is very dangerous. Donâ€™t let anyone hurt you! ðŸš«

Love alone is not enough to sustain a healthy relationship. You need compatibility, financial security, tolerance, will power, and the ability to sacrifice. 

Sharing your life with someone is very difficult. But please donâ€™t equate hurting with love. 

 This Bilbe verse tells us what love is.

New International Version <br/>
1 Corinthians 13:4-7 <br/>
4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Nowhere in that verse does it say, love hurts.
