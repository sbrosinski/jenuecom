I haven’t written any poetry in a long time, but yesterday I found myself writing again. When I write poetry, the pen moves my hand. The emotions write themselves. 

And my goodness, this one needed to be written. I don’t know if it has all the elements needed to be published, but I submitted it to a well-known publisher. Chances are slim that it’ll get accepted, but trying is free. 

Who knows, maybe this time they’ll say yes. 

The poem is called Hero. I unfortunately can’t post it yet because I’ve submitted it. But I’ll post it in the near future once the reviewing process is over. 

It’s amazing how much better I feel now that I’ve gotten all that emotion out of me and onto paper. 

How do you deal with heavy emotions? 

I have published work before! Here is my publishing history:
