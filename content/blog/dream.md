Last year I had to spend 5 days in the hospital because of a very difficult wisdom tooth. And ever since I’ve had a recurring dream where I’m lost in the hospital and I can’t find my way out. When I do finally find an exit, my doctor is guarding the door and won’t let me leave. 

Strange dream. I don’t like hospitals and I usually hate doctors, but this doctor is different. I like him and I’m not afraid of him, but for some reason I always wake up when he touches my hand. 

And then I realize that he sent me home. And now I'm wondering what's behind the door that he was guarding? Always the same dream…
