Last year I had to spend 5 days in the hospital because of a very difficult wisdom tooth. And ever since I’ve had a recurring dream where I’m lost in the hospital and I can’t find my way out. When I finally find an exit, my doctor is guarding the door and won’t let me leave. 

Strange dream. I don’t like hospitals and I usually hate doctors, but this doctor is different. I like him. I trust him. I’m not afraid of him, but for some reason I always wake up when he touches my hand. 

Then I realize that he sent me home. And even though I'm happy to be back in my own bed, I want to know what's behind the door that he was guarding. Why did I wake up when he touched my hand? I want him to escort me through the door. But so far it's always the same dream...
