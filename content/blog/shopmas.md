It’s Tuesday night. Bear is having a night out. Flamingo is sick and resting.  And Mongoose is making dinner.

I’ve just finished gift wrapping my last Christmas present and I’m so happy that “shopmus” is over. Now I can just relax and enjoy the holiday. I really want to put the Christmas tree up, but I’ve decided to wait until the first Advent.

Mongoose just recently recovered from Covid. Flamingo has the flu and might have infected the rest of us. Bear complained about not feeling well and this morning I had a scratchy throat.  It’s not just us; a lot of people are sick right now.

Seriously, all I want for Christmas is for everyone to be healthy. 🍎 🎄
