title: Unproductive Day
date: "2022-08-19"

Today the interruptions are relentless! It takes me at least 10 minutes to get in “the zone” where I’m coding and debugging comfortably. And if someone interrupts my concentration, usually for a stupid reason, I need another 10 minutes to find my focus again.

10 minutes there, 10 minutes here, it all adds up to an unproductive day.

Self-soothing with a cup of peppermint tea made from fresh peppermint leaves. 🫖
