In my previous apartment I could see the sunset from my balcony. It was one of the highlights of my day. In my current apartment that is no longer possible. The sunset is blocked by a tall building. Sometimes I catch the sunrise from my bathroom window though.

I enjoy the smell of coffee, that I donâ€™t like to drink. The feel of freshly washed sheets. The sound of rain hitting the windowpane, and the taste of warm banana bread with butter. Have you ever had warm banana bread soaked in rum? That is also a treat! 

I donâ€™t like soda/pop or any drinks with carbonation, except for a drink called Ginger Brew. Ginger Brew is my go-to soft drink and if thatâ€™s not available then iced tea.

In the summer months, I like to take evening walks before dinner. I walk to the duck pond and feed the ducks. Sometimes I see horses, deer, and frogs as well.  I canâ€™t wait for summer. I love summer evening walks. ðŸ¦‹

What brings you joy?
