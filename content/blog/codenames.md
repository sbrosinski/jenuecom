I use the concept of code names to protect the privacy of people that I mention in my blogs. Someone recently asked me, what’s your code name?

That’s a funny question. If I told you what my code name is then it really wouldn’t be “code” anymore, now would it? 🥸

But jokes aside, I don’t need a code name because this is my website. This is my blog. And I am Jenue (Jen-you). Yes, that’s my real name!
