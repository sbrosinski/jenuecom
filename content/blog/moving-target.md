I’m not the best person to ask for advice. I think my goals, values, and what makes me generally happy don’t align with modern popular opinion.

But if you want my advice anyway, I would say don’t put your self-worth into things that can be taken away from you.

Honestly, that’s something I’m working on. The words are easy to write and even easier to say but putting that concept into practice is not easy at all.

Relationships can be taken away from you. Money can be taken away from you. Assets can be taken away from you. And then you start thinking what else is there?

The knowledge that you have in your head can’t be stolen. The memories that you have can’t be lost. And how you treat people will speak volumes on your character. These three qualities define my self-worth.

It’s a moving target, but since when is anything worth having easy?
