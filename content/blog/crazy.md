title: Crazy (A poem)
date: "2024-01-25"

Last year I wrote nothing. 2023 was a rough year for me, so I understand why I didn’t write. Today, I woke up and there were words in my head, so I wrote them down. I knew I was writing a poem or attempting to write a poem but since I hadn’t written in so long, I was rather shocked that the quality is so good.

I don’t know how other writers write poetry, but with me, I can’t force it.  If the words don’t come on their own, I can’t write them. Does that make sense?

I had trouble putting a title to it. So, I’m just calling it crazy, because it’s about how crazy someone makes me feel. I was tempted to title it with the name of my muse, but I can’t do that. Why? Just because I think that my poem is flattering, doesn’t mean that the person I’m writing about will agree. People and feelings are very delicate. And I respect that!

From your point of view, you might think you are complementing someone. And your heart and intentions might be pure and noble, or at least you think so. But your words might be processed completely differently from the receiving end. And suddenly, you’re in the wrong. That’s why there are no names on my blog!

It’s always unfortunate if someone misinterprets your words. My policy is to NEVER write anything bad about someone. If I don’t like someone, I will not waste energy writing about them. If I’m angry, I will not write at all. I will never use my written words to derail someone. That’s not who I want to be.

But having said the above, it would be really nice to attach a proper name to this poem. Edgar Allan Poe often titled his poetry with names. I wish I could do that! But alas, I can’t. 🫤

Maybe I’ll post it. Maybe not. I don’t know yet.

Thank you, “Muse,” for the inspiration. Maybe someday I’ll get the courage and chance to share it with you. And I hope that it's welcomed. ❤︎
