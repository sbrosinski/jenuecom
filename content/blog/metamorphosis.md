I think I’m going through some sort of metamorphosis. I cut my hair!  I know, it was long overdue.  It took me two weeks to figure out how to style it, but I think I’m comfortable with it now.  I appreciate how versatile and effortless it is.

And I’ve changed my signature perfume. I’ve been wearing this scent since my college days! I guess one of the reasons for the change is that I’m tired of hunting it down.  They just don’t make the original anymore.  So, I spent a few days choosing my new signature.

I know that some women like to own a whole wall of perfume, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I don’t like changing perfumes.  I choose one that I really like and that closely matches my presence.  And it really does become my signature.

The thought of my upcoming birthday might be influencing a lot of my recent decisions. The hunt for a new perfume was almost a spiritual revival for me. I chose something that Cleopatra might wear.  And maybe… just maybe… I’ll inherit some of the elegance, charm, and charisma of a great queen.
