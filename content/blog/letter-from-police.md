title: Letter from The Police Department

I got a letter from the police department yesterday asking me to take part in a discrimination survey. They are trying to reduce hate crimes. 

The spam messages that I’m receiving are uniquely devised to harass me about my social status. And while I really don’t like accusing anyone of being racist, I can’t deny that it fits the definition. 

Somehow, I don’t think I got this letter coincidentally. I think someone knows that I’m possibly the target of racism and is trying to help me out. Maybe one of the stalker's friends? I don't know.
