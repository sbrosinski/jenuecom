Today Iâ€™m blogging directly from IntelliJ. Look at me, I'm learning stuff! ðŸ¤£

Iâ€™m spending this weekend decluttering, re-organizing, and cleaning so I can focus on studying and coding next week.

Not very exciting but necessary. And at the end of the day Iâ€™m always thankful for making progress.
