Iâ€™m finally going to see the Boston Philharmonic tomorrow and I just wanted to document my excitement. Itâ€™s been a really long time since I had a night out, and how often does someone get to see Zlatomir Fung and Benjamin Zander in concert? ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ¤©

Itâ€™s been a rainy June with cool temperatures. It hailed a few days ago. Today it rained the whole day. Whatever the weather looks like tomorrow, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll have a great day.

I donâ€™t have a camera and my phone takes awful pictures, but Iâ€™ll post my best picture of the concert hall in the next blog post.
