title: Hugs and Kisses Christmas Tree

I made these ascii hugs and kisses Christmas trees and would like to share them with you.
Just copy and paste. If the tree doesn’t paste completely in alignment you will have to 
adjust the spacing. Works really well in g-mail and looks amazing if you add color. So 
if you're tired of using the same old emojis give this a go. Tis the Season!
