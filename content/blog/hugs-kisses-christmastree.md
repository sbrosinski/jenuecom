I made this ascii hugs and kisses Christmas tree and would like to share it with you all. 
```
    _\/_
     /\
     /\
    /x \
   ♡/°°\o
   /o ♡ \
  /°°°°°°\
 o/x ♡ x \♡
 /°°°°°°°°\
/__x__♡__o_\
♡    ||   ♡
   \----/
    \__/

```
Just copy and paste. 
If the tree doesn’t paste completely in alignment you will have to adjust the spacing.
Works really well in g-mail and looks amazing if you add color. So if you're tired of
using the same old emojis give this a go. Tis the Season!
