I finally figured out what was causing all my digestive problems – Sugar Alcohols!!!

I’m also lactose intolerant, but I’ve been very sick the last two years even though I avoid lactose like the plague. I didn’t figure out until recently that I’m also very intolerant of sugar alcohols. And these sugar alcohols are in a lot of foods, especially sweets. Sometimes they are even in medicine! Unfortunately, they are also found naturally in a lot of fruits.

Here is a list of sugar alcohols that I now avoid:

* Sorbitol (E 420)
* Mannitol (E 421)
* Isomalt (E954)
* Maltitol and Maltitol Sirup (E 965)
* Lactitol (E 966)
* Xylitol (E 967)
* Erythritol (E 967)

Some derived chemicals are:

* Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan monolaurate (E 432)
* Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan monooleate (E 433)
* Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan monopalmitate (E 434)
* Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan monostearate (E 435)
* Polyoxyethylene Sorbitan tristearate (E 436)
* Sorbitan tristearate (E 491)
* Sorbitan monolaurate (E 493)
* Sorbitan monooleate (E 494)
* Sorbitan monopalmitate (E 495)

I'm really looking forward to feeling better!
