One of the funny things about me is that Iâ€™m really bad at small talk. How do I practice that? Anyway, I usually say inappropriate things to people. Like once an acquaintance proudly showed me a newborn baby. I asked whoâ€™s baby it was and she was a little offended. Oops! I never noticed she was pregnant.  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Once at a family gathering, I kindly offered to help an older lady find her missing earring. Only to find out that she only wore one earring! Oh boy!!! I was so embarrassed. ðŸ˜©

Then there was this time I tried to make small talk with this lady and commented that her hair was different only to find out that she was being treated for breast cancer. My heart broke! ðŸ’”

I always try to be nice but end up saying the wrong thing!
