title: Adjusting to New Glasses

Iâ€™m spending the next few days trying to get used to my new glasses. I didnâ€™t know that they would make me feel seasick. ðŸ¤¢

I have bifocals so I have to be conscious of where Iâ€™m looking. Going up and down stairs is especially weird.  I feel like Iâ€™m going to fall. 

I hope that I can adjust quickly because I have so much to do this week.
