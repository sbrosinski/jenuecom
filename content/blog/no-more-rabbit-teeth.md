Today is Flamingo’s last day wearing braces, so I made brunch and we ate together. We’ll also celebrate a little bit tomorrow after the braces come off. Gifts will be involved! 👑

I’m making a big deal out of it because it is a big deal. Flamingo had braces for almost 2 years, and it was not fun. Oh my gosh, that bite block was no joke.

Finally, no more rabbit teeth. Flamingo, you’re gorgeous. What am I saying? Of course, you are! We share 🧬. ❤︎ 😉
