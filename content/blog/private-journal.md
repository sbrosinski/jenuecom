 Since 2024 began, I started writing in a private journal recording my daily activities, feelings, food etc. I take a few minutes to write in my journal before bed, and this one little change in my daily life is unbelievably fulfilling. Iâ€™m not sure why, but Iâ€™ve become more motivated, focused, and productive.

If youâ€™re having trouble with motivation, I highly recommend starting a private journal.

This blog is also like a journal, but itâ€™s public and I, of course, donâ€™t write personal things here. That would be crazy! ðŸ˜‰
