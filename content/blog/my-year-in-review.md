title: My Year in Review
date: "2022-11-15"

I canâ€™t believe that 2022 is almost over. This year flew by. Here are the highlights of my year.

Fun Activities
* Austria
* Berlin
* Munich
* Moonchild
* Madame Tussauds
* Kendrick Lamar

Personal
* A big part of this year was spent dealing with an almost invisible online presence. â€˜dan thank you for thinking of me. I miss your annoying spam messages.


* I accidentally learned a new language. I really wasnâ€™t serious about learning Romanian, but the language is so beautiful that it took root in my heart.


* I figured out that I was using the wrong Java book. Iâ€™m very disappointed with my progress, but I have lots of time. I promise myself that I will continue to learn Java more efficiently next year.


* My fitness level has dropped. I will need to work more on flexibility and endurance.


* I want to improve my social skills, but I donâ€™t know where to begin.


* My family is well and thriving.


I love everyone who has been a part of my life this year. You all mean so much to me and I value every single one of you. I love you! ðŸ¥° ðŸ’•
