title: My Year in Review
date: "2022-11-15"

I canâ€™t believe that 2022 is almost over. This year flew by. Here are the highlights of my year.

Fun Activities
* Austria
* Berlin
* Munich
* Moonchild concert
* Madame Tussauds
* Kendrick Lamar concert

Personal

* I figured out that I was using the wrong Java book. Iâ€™m very disappointed with my progress, but I have lots of time. I made a promise to myself that I will continue to learn Java more efficiently next year.


* I need to work more on physical fitness, concentrating on flexibility and endurance. 


* I would also like to improve my social skills. Charisma, diplomacy and poise are traits that I wish to learn. But, is that even possible? 


* My family is well and thriving.


Bear, Flamingo and Mongoose, the three of you are my whole heart. I love you!! ðŸ¥° ðŸ’•
