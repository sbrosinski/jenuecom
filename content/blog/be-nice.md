Sometimes I think that I live in an age where being nice is considered creepy. If youâ€™re too nice people think you want something from them. But why? Why is it weird to be nice? I really donâ€™t understand it. 

I smile at people to make myself approachable. 

Iâ€™m helpful because I like to make people happy.

And I like making people happy because it makes me feel good. 

I say thank you and please because manners matter. Politeness is underrated! 

It feels good to be nice. If you donâ€™t believe me, do a random act of kindness and see how it makes you feel. 

I wonder if nice people live longer? I think the physical effects of being nice has real medicinal properties. Someone should do a study on this. Nice people vs. Mean people, who lives longer. What do you think? ðŸ¤”
