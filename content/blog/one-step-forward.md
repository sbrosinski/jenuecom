It’s really nice checking things off my to-do list.  It’s funny how just doing the little things can make you feel accomplished.

I now have all the required documents needed to start the next batch of legal paperwork.  I’m expecting to spend the next few days filling out forms and then waiting.  I think there will be more waiting involved than anything else.

January went quite well.  I even signed a DNR.  No, I am not sick.  But if death should suddenly find me, I want to go painlessly and quickly.  Look at me, being an adult.  And after years of wondering if I want to be an organ donor, my answer is no.

I’m still working on my language skills.  I’m still tinkering with coding as a hobby.  I work out twice a week.  I reduced my sugar intake and increased my water intake.  I feel a lot better.

I haven’t been writing as much as I used to, but maybe I’ll get back to that sometime.  I do what makes me happy.  And I realize that I’m immensely privileged to be able to just do what I want.  I’m thankful for that!

I’m not really comfortable sharing my political opinions publicly.  I don’t like politics.  Things are upside down in the United States right now.  But I have to be hopeful that the tyranny will be dealt with.  That’s all I’m comfortable saying.

On a happier note, apparently my catchphrase is, “I thought you had sense.”  Bear, Flamingo, and Mongoose all agree on this, so it must be true.  😂
