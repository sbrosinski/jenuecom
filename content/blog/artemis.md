I woke up this morning and watched the successful launch of Artemis 1. 🚀 

I was 11 years old when I watched the Challenger explode, live on TV, while I was sitting in class. We were all horrified. A whole crew of astronauts just died. After our teacher got over the initial shock, he led us in prayer. 

Ever since, I cringe at rocket launches. Even the ones without a crew. But Artemis was a beautiful sight to see. 

Nasa's tie cutting tradition is very cool! ✂️ 👔
