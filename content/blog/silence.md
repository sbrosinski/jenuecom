My best friend talks constantly. Once I asked her why she talks so much, and she said that she feels uncomfortable when it’s quiet. That’s the exact opposite of me. I don’t talk very much. I, of course, speak more to my friends and family, but in general I’m a quiet person.

I like silence. I’m often annoyed by my friend’s talking. And she tends to repeat herself. But she’s my best friend! Flamingo, if you ever read this post, I love you!!!

But please shut up sometimes!️ 🤫 🥰
