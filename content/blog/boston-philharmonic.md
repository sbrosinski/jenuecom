I have tickets to the Boston Philharmonic in June. The only thing that I know about music is that I like listening to it. I tried playing the ukulele and was horrible at it! ðŸ˜… I wouldnâ€™t describe myself as a bourgie person, but I think that if youâ€™re privileged enough to have the opportunity to go to a big concert hall then you should take it.  Iâ€™m using the word privilege here because tickets were really expensive. The only way that I can justify spending 400 euro is that I need and deserve a night out.

Benjamin Zander and Zlatomir Fung seem to be a big deal in their genre of music.  Iâ€™m sure that Iâ€™ll have a memorable evening.  

I know that I probably wonâ€™t be allowed to take pictures in the concert hall, but Iâ€™ll share what I can here on my blog.
