I only wanted what you are able to give me. And if nothing is all you have to give then I will gladly accept it, because even nothing is something.

It’s the memory of me falling into your eyes, and you falling into mine.

It’s the tension that wrapped us together and pushed us off the cliff.

It’s letting go to save ourselves, and realizing that we’re falling up.

It’s seeing you happy.

Your gift of nothing is precious.

It’s knowing that you flew away - close to me.
