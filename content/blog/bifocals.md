My first pair of glasses were bifocals. I wore them for a year and never got used to them. They made the bottom half of my field of vision blurry.

And if I wanted to read, the glasses made me move my head up and down the page resulting in neck pain.

So ultimately, I ended up buying two new pairs of glasses. If you’re new to glasses be warned. Some people, like me, don’t adjust to bifocals. But the stupid thing is, you won’t know until you try it.

I’ll update my profile picture with my new glasses later.
