I’m trying to figure out why a flux of dark content is in my Youtube feed. I usually don’t scroll, but the first 8 videos are literally in your face.

It was a lot of mean, hurtful anime. I don’t even like anime, so I’m struggling to understand why I had anime in my feed at all. Memes that say, “I hate you,” “You useless f*ck,” “You’re stupid,” “No one wants you,” and even “what if I killed someone for you.”

Just to make sure I wasn’t over-reacting, I let my computer science teacher scroll through my feed. He was appalled! I reported the really nasty ones, and weeded the others out by clicking on the not interested button.

Did someone hack into my account? I really don’t know. I’m not sure if this is linked to the “spam attack” that I was having a few months ago. If it is, I don’t know what to think.

I don’t want anyone to be consumed with hate. Especially if it’s because of something that I’ve done. I’m sorry. Sometimes I do and say stupid things without meaning to hurt anyone. And I know that saying I’m sorry probably doesn’t mean anything, but it’s all I’ve got. 

I'm actually really heartbroken. 😔
