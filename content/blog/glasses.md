I finally went to the optician today. Yes, Iâ€™m blind. ðŸ¤“ I ordered 2 pairs of glasses before I left. This was on the top of my summer to do list and Iâ€™m happy that I can finally check it off.  I canâ€™t wait to pick up my glasses in the next few weeks! It's going to be so nice to finally see properly again.
