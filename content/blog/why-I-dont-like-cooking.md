Flamingo doesnâ€™t like rice, and except for bananas, doesnâ€™t like fruit. 

Mongoose is also lactose intolerant and allergic to beans but will try most foods.

Bear is not lactose intolerant but has an irrational fear of milk. Also doesnâ€™t like eggs, fish or any kind of seafood, and wonâ€™t eat any meat that hasnâ€™t been deboned. ðŸ™„

Iâ€™m lactose intolerant. I have an intolerance to sugar alcohols. I donâ€™t like beans. I despise the taste of hazelnuts. And I think Iâ€™m allergic to mangoes.

I donâ€™t cook very often because HOW? Finding one dish that we all like is impossible. We all like garlic bread. Thatâ€™s it! ðŸ˜­
