I was recently accused of being cynical. A friend wanted to take a walk, but it was already dark outside, so I told her that it wasn’t a good idea. And that started a whole discussion. Why isn’t it a good idea for women to take a walk after dark?

While I adore my friend's childlike view of the world, experience has taught me that it’s made up of more than just butterflies and rainbows. Taking precaution isn’t cynical, it’s common sense. And due to the nature of nature, sometimes women need to have a little more common sense than men.
