Class 2

In this week’s German class, the lesson(s) that stood out the most are:

Expressions using color.
* Wer sich sehr ärgert, ärgert sich grün und blau.
* Eine Person, di alle kennen, ist bekannt wie ein bunter Hund. (negative)
* Was nicht perfekt ist, ist nicht das Gelbe vom Ei.

In the 5-hour class there was a lot of teamwork and expressing of ideas and opinions. I was able to work well with my small group as everyone was very respectful and considerate, even though I’m the weakest speaker in the class.  

I doubt if I will ever be a strong speaker, so I’m focusing more on reading comprehension, listening comprehension, and improving my general German grammar. If decide to speak I want it to be as clear and concise as possible.

Today my family taught me how to pronounce the German Z. Because apparently, I’m doing it all wrong.  It’s something like “tsZ.”  We also practiced the German R. My R sounds too Yankee.  Oh My! 😂
