In this week’s German class, the lesson(s) that stood out the most are:

Expressions using color.
* Wer sich sehr ärgert, ärgert sich grün und blau.
* Eine Person, di alle kennen, ist bekannt wie ein bunter Hund. (negative)
* Was nicht perfekt ist, ist nicht das Gelbe vom Ei.

In the 5-hour class there was a lot of teamwork and expressing of ideas and opinions. I was able to work well with my small group as everyone was very respectful and considerate, even though I’m the weakest speaker in the class.  

I doubt if I'll ever be a strong speaker, so I’m focusing more on reading comprehension, listening comprehension, and improving my general German grammar. If I decide to speak I want it to be as clear and concise as possible. Writing in German is difficult. There are way more rules than written English. All I can say is that I'll do my best.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Today my family taught me how to pronounce the German Z. Because apparently, I’m doing it all wrong.  It’s something like “tsZ.”  We also practiced the German R. My R sounds too Yankee.  Oh My! 😂
