Every Good Boy Deserves Fun

If you have ever studied music, you know where that sentence comes from. During my childhood years my mom thought she could make me musical.

Haha! I remember being completely frustrated trying to make my side flute make some sort of noise. Holy crap! If you don’t place it on your lips just right, it makes absolutely no sound. And then once I did manage to make sound, the long notes killed me. It seemed that I could never hold my breath long enough.

Then I took piano lessons and was bored out of my mind. I just didn’t want to.

As an adult, I figured out that I really like the ukulele. I own a tenor ukulele and it makes the most beautiful sound, even when I hit the wrong notes. I tell myself that if I get really good at playing, I might try playing the guitar. But that’s a big if!

I think everyone can play a musical instrument. You just have to find the right one for you.

Make Every Day Fun!
