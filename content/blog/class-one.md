I recently started a B2 German class.  I’m way out of my comfort zone, but I knew that would happen before I signed up for the class. It’s intentional. I need to change and pushing myself out of my comfort zone is the only way to begin.

I plan to blog about something new that I’ve learned from every class. My takeaway from the first class is: “Hätte hätte Fahrradkette”. That’s the equivalent to the English, “Could have, would have, should have… but you didn’t.”

I’ve never heard this German expression before. I’m thrilled to add it to my vocabulary. 😊
