Last night my family took me out to our favorite Greek restaurant to celebrate my belated birthday. I usually have good luck with this restaurant, but I ended up ordering something I didn’t like. The waiter noticed that I didn’t eat my food, so he subtracted my meal from the bill. That was very considerate of him.

I ordered lamb with rice and salad. I didn’t eat the salad because it came already covered in yogurt dressing and I’m hyper lactose intolerant.  I thought the lamb was going to be grilled lamb with a side of rice, but I got lamb stewed in tomato sauce, served over watery rice. The dish came displayed in what looked like a gravy bowl. 😲 The presentation was questionable. The sauce was salty and the lamb was so leathery that I could barely swallow it. I didn't want to offend anyone, but I physically couldn’t eat what I was given. 

The waiter seemed annoyed that I didn’t immediately ask for something else, but it’s not in my nature to complain. I didn’t order dessert because everything was laced with lactose.  I wasn’t upset about it. Sometimes that’s just how it is.

I went home, had a banana and a Snickers bar, watched a few episodes of The Big Bang Theory, and went to bed happy.
