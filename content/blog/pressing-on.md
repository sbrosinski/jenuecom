Pressing On

I find myself in the uncomfortable situation of having no plans for the future. I had a plan, at least I thought I had a plan. And then someone told me that even if I reach my goal, I would still have to do X-Y-Z to move forward. 

The discouragement was devastating. I stopped and did nothing at all.  The only thing that I accomplished this year was getting my bad wisdom tooth removed. It was a horrible experience. I somehow ended up in the heart station of the hospital because I had trouble waking up. 

Sometimes I wish that I hadnâ€™t. Then at least I wouldnâ€™t have to figure out what to do with my life. ~ *Deep Breath* ~  I have no choice but to press on. Without encouragement. Without support. Hoping that somehow, Iâ€™ll be okay. 

And you know, I think I will be. I donâ€™t break so easily.  Itâ€™s time to move forward. If no one believes in you, you have to believe in yourself. And on my journey, I will be a source of encouragement and sunshine for others. ðŸŒžðŸŒ»
