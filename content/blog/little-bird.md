I woke up early this morning to the sound of a little bird chirping around my window. What a wonderful way to wake up! Last night was so warm that I slept with my bedroom window open.

It’s currently 21° C.  I’ve been enjoying the estival weather. Sunshine makes me happy.  🌞

I’m going on vacation in a few days.  I’m not really excited about it, at least not yet.  I’m sure it will be fun, but there’s still so much to do that I can’t unwind.

I have a blooming tomato plant on my balcony, and I don’t have anyone to water it while I’m gone.  I hope it survives. This is my first time growing my own vegetables so I’m really looking forward to those tomatoes. I didn’t realize that tomato plants get so tall and wide. This one tomato plant takes up a lot of space on my balcony. 

Yes, I know that tomatoes are botanically fruit. But they identify as vegetables! 🍅  😉

Watching plants grow is so rewarding. Maybe I should start a real garden?
