Mongoose has a negative test. Yay! 👏 🥳

Me and Bear still positive.

Flamingo immune.

Before I fell asleep last night, I had a mean coughing attack. Nasty! Somehow, I still managed to sleep well. But I woke up weak and tired. And I had a sore throat from coughing so hard.  I don’t think I have diarrhea, but I had to run to the bathroom a few times.

Hopefully this is over soon. This virus is mean. Just when you feel better, an hour later you feel sick again. I don’t want to imagine what this would be like if we weren’t vaccinated.
