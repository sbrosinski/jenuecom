Working on a Java loop exercise from the book, “Think Java”.  Yes, I know. I’m really behind. I should already be done with this book, but I’m not. 😯

I’m writing a method that takes a String and returns a Boolean indicating whether the word is abecedarian. An abecedarian is a word that has letters in alphabetical order. For example: biopsy, behint, dehort...

For me this is very complicated, so I hope I won’t take too long to get it done. Wish me luck! 

When I'm done I'll post my working code.
