Finally got the results of the German B1 Test from the Goethe Institut.

I passed the Listening (83/100), Reading (80/100), and Writing (73/100) part of the test. Iâ€™m super proud of this! ðŸŽ‰

But I totally failed the speaking part of the test (51/100). I mean I failed hard. I failed so badly that itâ€™s hard not to laugh about it. ðŸ˜‚

I donâ€™t know if I want to retake this part of the test though. There is no way to practice for it. They basically give you a topic and you have to give a mini impromptu presentation on it in front of 3 people. They ask you questions afterwards. I also had to plan a Sommerfest with another student. The whole thing took about 20 minutes. 

I don't agree with the results of the speaking test. Iâ€™m actually pretty confident in the way I speak. Of course, I don't speak perfectly but I know how to get my point across and people understand what I mean. I thought that was the whole point of speaking at level B1. I would like to know where I lost 49 points. I wish I could challenge the grade, but I don't think that's possible. Unlike the first three tests, the speaking test is a subjective evaluation. And that can only be challenged if the test was video recorded, which it was not. 

Oh well, it's not the end of the world. I'm more happy about the parts of the test that I passed than sad about the small part of the test that I supposedly "failed".  

Now, on to the next test. I still have a few weeks to study. This one isn't that hard. It's more memorizing that anything else and I have excellent memory. 

Wish me luck!
