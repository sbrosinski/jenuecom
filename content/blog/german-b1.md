Finally got the results of the German B1 Test.

I passed the Listening, Reading, and Writing part of the test. Iâ€™m super proud of this! ðŸŽ‰

But I totally failed the speaking part of the test. I mean I failed hard. I failed so badly that itâ€™s hard not to laugh about it. ðŸ˜‚

I donâ€™t know if I want to retake this part of the test though. There is no way to practice for it. They basically give you a topic and you have to give a mini impromptu presentation on it in front of 3 people. And they ask you questions afterwards.

I don't agree with the results of the speaking part of the test. Iâ€™m actually pretty confident in the way I speak. Of course, I don't speak perfectly but I know how to get my point across and people understand what I mean. I thought that was the whole point of speaking at level B1. 

Oh well, it's not the end of the world. I'm more happy about the parts of the test that I passed than sad about the small part of the test that I didn't pass.  

Now, on to the next test. I still have a few weeks to study. This one isn't that hard. It's more memorizing that anything else and I have excellent memory. 

Wish me luck!
