I’ve noticed an increase in traffic on this blog. At first, I thought it’s just bots because this blog is very mundane and unless you know me, why would you be here?  But, from the engagement overview, the interactions are oddly coordinated to my current posts.  I don’t know if this is just a figment of my imagination, but it feels like someone’s playing with me. 

I wasn’t going to blog about this, but on second thought I’d like to say hello.  Do I know you?  Does your name rhyme with Big Dan? 🔬 👀

Another possibility is that I’m being investigated. In that case, I promise I’m a nice person. 😇
