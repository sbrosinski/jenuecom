I never thought twice about telling people that I speak German, but since I took the B1 German test at the Goethe Institut and failed the speaking test with an extremely low score of 51/100, I think I shouldn’t be telling people that I can speak German.

Even though I passed the Reading (80/100), the Listening (83/100), and writing (73/100) sections of the German B1, I don’t think that’s enough to claim that I “speak” German.

I don’t want to lie to people. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to lie to anyone. Up until this point I really believed that I could speak German. From now on I will just say that I can’t speak German very well.

I’ve also changed this information on my about page.
