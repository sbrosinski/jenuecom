title: No Internet

Our internet provider has left us (and the entire apartment building) without internet for 2.5 full days now. And itâ€™s still not fixed. Iâ€™m a very meek and understanding person, but this is really unacceptable. I feel like I want to fight somebody. ðŸ˜¡

The only way I can get internet at home is by creating a hotspot with my cell phone. Thank God for backdoors!
