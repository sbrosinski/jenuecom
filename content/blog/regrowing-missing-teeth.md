Everyone seems to be excited about this new drug that will supposedly regrow missing teeth. And I admit, at face value, this seems like good magic.

But Iâ€™m worried because this drug canâ€™t target which missing teeth it grows back. The video said that it will regrow ALL your missing teeth. Most people have their wisdom teeth removed, and thatâ€™s considered missing teeth. I really wouldnâ€™t risk having all 4 of my wisdom teeth grow back!

Mongoose had all 4 of his wisdom teeth removed plus two other adult teeth because his jaw was overcrowded. This drug will grow all of his teeth back. Yikes! ðŸ˜±

I understand that for some people this might work though. And who knows, maybe someday they will figure out how to target specific teeth. Iâ€™m curious what the side effects are, but I'm also hopeful.
