Throughout my lifetime I’ve always been able to find someone to hold onto. A kindred spirit to comfort me when everything is cloudy. But right now all I’m holding onto is me. 

I fill my heart with flowers. And enjoy the feel of the sun on my skin. The breeze whispers in my ear, “You’re okay.” 

And that's enough for me. 🌻
