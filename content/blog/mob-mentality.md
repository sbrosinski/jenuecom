Mob mentality is becoming a real epidemic. People don’t think for themselves anymore. Popular opinion on social media has taken place of logic. The sheer volume of stupidity is overwhelming. Yet, people believe what they’re told to believe. People feel what they're told to feel. Questions unasked, facts unchecked, and morality at the mercy of the masses for approval.
