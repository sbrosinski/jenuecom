Too much of anything is never a good thing, including money. It’ s my observation that wealthy people are often miserable.  

Don’t waste your life chasing money. It will only make you unhappy. You will guard it and hoard it and push good people away because you think all they want is your money. 

Who wants to live like that? I don’t!
