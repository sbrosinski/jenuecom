Today’s Easter Monday and I woke up to the headline that Pope Francis has died. I think it was quite cruel that one of his last meetings was with JD Vance, the VP of the newly corrupt USA. From the Pope's body language, I don't think he wanted to meet with him. 

I am a devout protestant. I was raised in the German Lutheran Church, but as an adult I feel more comfortable in the Baptist church. Although I’m not Catholic, I am sincerely saddened by the death of Pope Francis. And in the same breath, I am intrigued to see who the next Pope will be.

I hope everyone had a very blessed Easter. Happy Spring to my non-Christian friends. 🌷🐝

Rest in Peace Pope Francis. †
