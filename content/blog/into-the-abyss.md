I think I’m crazy.<br/>
I’m not sure we met.<br/>
I certainly don’t know you,<br/>
But I do --- sort of.<br/>
<br/>

Are you real? I think you’re<br/>
real. But how are you so<br/>
magnetic? Your presence<br/>
pulls me close. And no matter<br/>
how hard I try, I can’t break free.<br/>
<br/>

And I know I’m crazy.<br/>
Because I’m trying to break free,<br/>
but I don’t want to.<br/>
<br/>

I didn’t see your face.<br/>
Just your eyes. Kind of beautiful.<br/>
Hypnotic. Comforting one<br/>
moment, angry the next.<br/>
<br/>

You want me to look away.<br/>
<br/>

But I don’t. I see you.<br/>
You are gentle and kind.<br/>
But you’re not allowed to show it.<br/>
Instead, you display a blue flame.<br/>
<br/>

I fell.<br/>
Somewhere into the abyss<br/>
of your eyes. It’s bright<br/>
and burning. Smiling and<br/>
sad.<br/>
<br/>

Now I can see the rest<br/>
of your face. And I’m not<br/>
sure why, but this makes you<br/>
angry.<br/>
<br/>

My --- I want to say friend,<br/>
but I know we’re not.<br/>
I am sorry.<br/>
Sorry, with my whole heart.<br/>
<br/>
