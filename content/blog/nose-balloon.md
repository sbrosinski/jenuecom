After I had Covid my ears started to clog up. They would randomly “pop” and I constantly had the feeling that I’m sitting in a landing airplane. Oh my gosh, I was worried about having to explain that to an ear doctor, but surprisingly, he understood what I meant.

I don’t have an ear infection. And my hearing is still fine! Doc prescribed nose spray and a nose balloon. Yup, you read that right. Nose balloon. What the heck is that?!

Welp, I’m sitting here trying to blow up a small balloon with my nose. If I understood correctly, it’s supposed to fix the imbalance between my inner and outer ear. But boy do I feel dumb! 🤡 

I hope this works.
