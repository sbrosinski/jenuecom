I was reminiscing with a friend about the good old days. We talked about things that annoyed us. And as we talked, we both laughed at our past selves and our silly situations.

I remembered how my very first car would constantly break down. How I desperately tried to understand physics in high school. Oh, and that one time that I had to speak in class and accidentally said testicles instead of tentacles. ðŸ¤£ Everyone laughed for at least 5 minutes straight and my teacher nearly died of amusement.

So, if youâ€™re going through an annoying time right now, please remember that in a few years it will be a source of entertainment for you and your friends. You will have a story to tell.

And isn't that what life's about? Making memories and gathering stories is the absolute pinnacle of living.
