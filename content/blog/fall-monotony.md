I haven’t posted in a while because I’ve settled in my new routine and life is just repeating itself right now. But there’s a coziness in monotony that’s predictable and safe. I’m enjoying the fall colors, the cooler temperatures, and the slow disappearance of annoying summer insects. And as Mother Nature prepares for winter, which is not my favorite time of year, I'm reminded that there’s beauty in every season. 🍁🍃🍂
