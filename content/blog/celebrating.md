A year ago today, I was in the hospital getting a very difficult wisdom tooth removed. There were complications and I ended up in the heart station. But my wisdom tooth was gone! AND the surgeon managed not to break my jaw during the procedure. AND he also miraculously didnâ€™t touch any of the surrounding nerves. AND the cardiologists couldnâ€™t find anything wrong with my heart! 

I dodged several bullets that day. I never considered myself a beautiful woman, so I didnâ€™t realize how precious my face is until my doctor said that I could lose feeling in my lips, tongue, and have a huge scar from the screws that he would use to wire a broken jaw shut.

It was an excruciating experience, but Iâ€™m still here! So, today Iâ€™m celebrating life. Iâ€™m so happy to live a normal, simple life completely undamaged and completely healed. 

Dr. B.P. thank you so much! ðŸ’˜
