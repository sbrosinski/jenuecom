Last week on Friday the 13th, the children in my apartment decided to have fun.  They played on the elevator, stopped on every floor, rang doorbells and then quickly ran away.  When I opened the door, I saw potato chip crumbs on my welcome matt. There was giggling down the stairs and the sound of the elevator opening and closing.

They rang my doorbell a few times that same evening, but I was never fast enough to catch the little rascals. It was funny. ðŸ˜‚ 

I love a good Christmas haunting! ðŸ‘» ðŸŽ„
