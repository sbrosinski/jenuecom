Today I’m feeling overwhelmed by the massive size of information that I have to somehow upload into my head. I know that in situations like this I should step closer to the project instead of stepping back, but right now I’m at a standstill.

Deep Breath. The library inside my head reminds me of this:

During a stay at hotel Marriott Courtyard, in Oberpfaffenhofen, I met a lady from Bangladesh. Chance placed us next to each other at breakfast. Our initial hellos and good morning turned into a mini conversation. I discovered that she was in Germany to take a course. That piqued my interest, so I probed for more information and found out that she was working for the British Navy.

Wow! Just wow. She was so nice and charming and humble.  I’m going to take a hint from whatever higher power that placed us next to each other and keep pressing on. My road might involve a series of failure. But that’s Okay!
