Today the test line on my covid test was so faint that I could hardly see it. I think by tomorrow I shouldnâ€™t see a line at all. I feel stronger than yesterday, but I know that can change at any time.

Bear also still has covid and was up most of last night fighting an extremely painful sinus headache. A doctor was called in the middle of the night!
