I had a wonderful St. Nick’s Day! There was a huge marzipan cake and I love marzipan.  I like marzipan so much that it’s hard for me to understand that some people don’t like it.  I mean it’s so good, why don’t you like marzipan?  I like anything with almonds.

I have a strong dislike for Nutella, nougat, and anything that tastes like hazelnut. I really don’t like hazelnuts! But I know that most people really like it.

My Christmas tree is up. The apartment is clean and decorated.  And I’m all done with Christmas shopping. Yay!!!!  Now I can just enjoy the holidays.

I hope you have a calm and relaxing December.
