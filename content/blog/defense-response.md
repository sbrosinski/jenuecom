Another funny thing about me:

When I’m annoyed I can and will “unlearn German” very quickly. 

I seriously can go from understanding everything you say, to I don’t speak German in less than 60 seconds. 

It’s just one of my defense responses. I can either fight, flee, or not understand you. And “Entschuldigung, ich spreche kein Deutsch,” usually works!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
