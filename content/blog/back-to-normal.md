After the negative covid test, I was still stick for a whole week! Maybe a bit longer. I think Iâ€™m over it now, but I get tired easily. Iâ€™ve been forcing myself to move anyway.

Today, I finally cut my ridiculously long hair. I cut about half the length. And itâ€™s still long, but not ridiculously long. ðŸ˜‰ It now falls just a few inches below my shoulders. 

The next few days will be spent slowly getting back into my old routine. I feel like Iâ€™ve been sick forever, and Iâ€™m tired of being sick. Weâ€™ve been getting a few more days of sunshine, and it brings me so much joy. Some flowers are starting to bloom again. Spring is just around the corner! I canâ€™t wait to say goodbye to Winter.
