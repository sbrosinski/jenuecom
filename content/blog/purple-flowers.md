Spring is in the air! I saw these lovely purple flowers today and the weather was even more beautiful than yesterday. I enjoyed the sunshine.

I had a nice conversation with my mom.  We donâ€™t talk very often. We talked about the weather, food, and hair care products. My mother and I donâ€™t share the same interest. We donâ€™t think alike, so talking to each other is tricky.  Keeping our conversations shallow saves our mental health. Whatever works, right? 

Iâ€™ve been blogging way more than I have time for. My next blog post will be in a few weeks. Iâ€™m working on a project that I really want to finish. So, see you later. ðŸ˜Š
