I still have covid, but I’m starting to feel better. Bear also still has covid. Flamingo has a little cold, nothing to worry about.

My symptoms today include clogged ears, stuffy nose, and still coughing up phlegm. Nasty! Symptoms are worst in the morning and then clears up quickly. So from noon on, I don’t have many symptoms. But I've been feeling very shaky, weak, and tired every day.  

I’ve been taking nose spray, Bronchipret cough medicine, and vitamin D.
