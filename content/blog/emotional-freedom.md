I miss the free-range emotional freedom that children enjoy. Theyâ€™re allowed to cry when a nurse pokes them with a needle. When they get angry no oneâ€™s stopping them from having a temper tantrum. They brutally speak without filter. Theyâ€™re not afraid to say, I love you. Theyâ€™re not afraid to say, I hate you. Theyâ€™re allowed to be afraid and hold onto their teddy bear.  

As an adult, you can only dream of having that much emotional freedom. I would give almost anything to show my feelings without consequences. My emotions are, however, written on my face. I never learned how to control my facial expressions. ðŸ˜‡

So, you will know if I like you without me saying a word. And, unfortunately, the opposite is also true.  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
