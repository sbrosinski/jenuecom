Mongoose has covidâ€¦ again! Bear is still negative. Flamingo is still negative.  And Iâ€™m still negative.

Is this going to happen every Autumn/Winter? ðŸ¥º So annoying! We had plans this weekend. Welp, thatâ€™s canceled. I hope we can still make it to the theater on Halloween.

Iâ€™ve had a cough for the past two days, so Iâ€™m hoping that I remain negative. But we shall see. The good thing about having covid multiple times is that you know how your body is going to respond to the virus.  It might be annoying but weâ€™ll recover.
