Welp, it looks like I’m taking the naturalization test tomorrow. Hopefully it won't be too difficult. It’s an hour long. 33 multiple choice questions.

I think I’m finally ready to do this. I was reluctant at first because the whole process is quite grueling. I have to get all the required B1 certificates. I’m confident that I will eventually acquire the one that’s missing. After I get all the required documents then I have to actually apply for naturalization. I think it’s going to take at least another year, maybe two, until completion.

This wasn’t the way I planned 2024. I didn’t realize that studying for the B1 and the Einbürgerungstest would take up so much of my time. As a foreign person whose native language is English, I think the tests are difficult. And in my opinion, the B1 speaking test is humiliating. But you have to do what you have to do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I’m a little nervous, so wish me luck!
