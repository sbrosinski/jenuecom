Welp, it looks like Iâ€™m taking the naturalization test tomorrow. Hopefully, it won't be too difficult. Itâ€™s an hour long. 33 multiple choice questions.

I think Iâ€™m finally ready to do this. I was reluctant at first because the whole process is quite grueling. I have to get all the required B1 certificates. Iâ€™m confident that I will eventually acquire the one thatâ€™s missing. After I get all the required documents then I have to actually apply for naturalization. I think itâ€™s going to take at least another year, maybe two, until completion.

This wasnâ€™t the way I planned 2024. I didnâ€™t realize that studying for the B1 and the EinbÃ¼rgerungstest would take up so much of my time. As a foreign person whose native language is English, I think the tests are difficult. 

 The reading test contains a lot of deductive reasoning questions. It feels more like you're taking an IQ test, but in German. Also, the test is relatively long but you only have 60 minutes to finish. This means that you must read, translate and process the information very quickly. Even though I passed this test with a decent score, I can't say that it was easy. 
 
Bear, who is a computer scientist and native German, took a mock reading B1 German test and found that it was not as easy as he had anticipated.

Also in my opinion, the B1 speaking test is humiliating. Why do they make us have spontaneous pretend conversations and force us to give impromptu speeches on random topics? They make us as nervous as possible and then tell us to speak in front of two people who are continuously taking notes. ðŸ’€ But you have to do what you have to do. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

I'll be a little nervous tomorrow, so wish me luck!
