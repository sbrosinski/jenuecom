I still donâ€™t know what caused me to break out in hives. Maybe it was the medicine that my doctor gave me? Or an ingredient in the new tea that I was trying to cure myself? I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ but Iâ€™m still not feeling well. I still have trouble eating. Sometimes my heart races for no reason, and I get tired easily.

My doctor didnâ€™t help at all. He gave me something for my tummy, which didnâ€™t work. He ordered blood work and when that came back normal, I was at a dead end. He asked me how my life is at home and blamed it on stress! ðŸ™„

  I guess I canâ€™t blame the doctor. If my symptoms get worse, Iâ€™ll just have to go back or find another doctor.
