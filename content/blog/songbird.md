Songbird is my favorite song. That's an understatement. This song has been with me since my young adult days and has escorted me through good times and bad times. It has celebrated my milestones. It knows my secrets. It calms my fears. And it has cured many heartbreaks.

I havenâ€™t said I love you to anyone in a long time but if this song was a person, Iâ€™d whisper those magic words in his ear. ðŸ’–ðŸ’•
