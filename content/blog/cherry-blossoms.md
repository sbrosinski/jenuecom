I spent the day under the cherry blossom trees. The weather was gorgeous!  There were a lot of people enjoying the cherry blossoms and taking pictures. This is one of my favorite times of the year.

I could feel the happiness of everyone round me. As pretty as this picture is, being here in person is twice as breathtaking. It feels like youâ€™re in a fairy tale. ğŸ§š ğŸŒ¸ ğŸ’•
