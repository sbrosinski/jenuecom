I spent the day under the cherry blossom trees. The weather was gorgeous!  There were a lot of people enjoying the cherry blossoms and taking pictures. This is one of my favorite times of the year.

I could feel the happiness of everyone around me. As pretty as this picture is, being there in person was twice as breathtaking. I felt like I was in a fairy tale. ğŸ§š ğŸŒ¸ ğŸ’•
