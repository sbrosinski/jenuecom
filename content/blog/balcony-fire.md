title: Balcony Fire
date: "2025-10-04"

This morning (around 3 a.m.) the apartment balcony across the street caught on fire. The firefighters worked quickly, but it took about 30 to 45 minutes.  From what I gathered, the garbage on their balcony caught on fire. How did that happen? My guess would be cigarettes.

The flashing lights and overall commotion of the situation kept some of us awake, but I donâ€™t think anyone was hurt. A few hours later I woke up to the wonder sound of the crazy lady downstairs yelling at her kids.

Iâ€™m so tired! ðŸ˜´
