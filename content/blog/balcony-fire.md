title: Balcony Fire
date: "2025-10-04"

This morning (around 3 a.m.) the apartment balcony across the street caught on fire. The firefighters worked quickly, but it took about 30 to 45 minutes to put the fire out. From what I gathered, the garbage on their balcony was burning. But what started the fire? My guess would be cigarettes.

The flashing lights and overall commotion of the situation kept some of us awake, but I don’t think anyone was hurt. A few hours later I woke up to the wonderful sound of the crazy lady downstairs yelling at her kids.

I’m so tired! 😴
