I’m curious why 9 people clicked on the same story? I wrote “The Lucky Card” in 2006, so it’s kind of weird that so many people are interested in the story now.

I got the idea for that story because several people told me that I’m a good luck charm. They were convinced that good things happen to them when I’m standing nearby. Funny, right? 

Anywho, if you have questions please ask. My e-mail address is on the landing page. I usually answer my messages in a timely and friendly manner.
