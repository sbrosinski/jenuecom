I just wanted to document this.  Someone has been stalking me. I think I know who it is but I’m not going to mention any names right now.

He has been sending me spam emails for over a month now. At first glance it just looks like normal spam that everyone gets. But a closer look and you will see that the spam is strangely specific.  

It started with spam offering me things like gaming equipment. And then spam with me winning $500 worth in groceries. And Oh look, I’ve won this car and that car.  

I think he wants me to click on the link.

He sometimes coordinates the spam with my blogs.

I tried offering to talk to him once, by blogging, and that’s when he sent a spam back and called me “mierda puta,” which means dirty or shitty whore.

I answered him back, again by blogging.  

And he sent me spam back with “Payback” written in the subject line. 

Now he’s sending me spam about sex and online dating. Obviously implying once again that I’m a whore.

I think I know who he is… But I honestly have no clue why he’s so angry. 

And I’m at the point where I’m afraid of him. Because I don’t know how far he will escalate the situation. I don’t know how far he will go.  

It’s obvious that he thinks about me a lot. He hates me!

I thought it was over because the messages stopped for a while, but they’ve started again. 

I don’t know what to do about it. So, I’m documenting everything here and saving all the spam messages!
