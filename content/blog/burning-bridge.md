My life is not full of many wins, but Iâ€™ve learned to live with it. So, I usually under-react to situations because I expect a certain level of disappointment or unfairness. Thatâ€™s how I keep my anger under control.

But a few days ago, Goose did something to me that tipped my scale. I became so angry that I literally cursed Goose out. Then I blocked Goose from contacting me again. Seriously, bridge burned to the ground!

I had a few days to reflect on that situation, and I stand by my decision.  I had every right to be angry.

I guess thatâ€™s how it is. Sometimes in life you have to burn bridges and let them stay burned. ðŸŒ‹
