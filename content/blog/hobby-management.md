Sometimes itâ€™s really difficult to schedule coding practice into my day. I was so busy this week that I didnâ€™t do any coding at all. But thatâ€™s okay. Right now, programming isnâ€™t my 1st priority so I can afford the practice delay. 

Hopefully, I can catch up over Easter break. Have a great Easter! And if you donâ€™t celebrate Easter, then Happy Spring! ðŸŒ·
