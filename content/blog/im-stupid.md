After being sick to the point where I was almost bedridden for the last two years, possibly from long-covid, I wanted to finally enjoy making a full recovery in 2024.

Studying for German tests isnâ€™t how I planned to spend my first year feeling healthy again. This was all Bearâ€™s idea. He signed me up for the damn tests. I paid for them. Oh my gosh, Iâ€™m so dumb! 

So, for the first 4 months in 2024 I had to spend a lot of time studying German, which I donâ€™t enjoy, so I could pass a series of tests that I really donâ€™t need. And I managed to pass all but one.

Now I feel obligated to retake the test that I failed because I generally finish what I start. Meaning thereâ€™s more tests in my near future and more worry, and more looming, and more German grammar. And all for what?  I don't know.

Please help me. I really donâ€™t want to do this anymore. ðŸ˜”
