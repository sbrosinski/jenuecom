title: New Profile Picture with New Glasses

I finally changed my profile picture! I didnâ€™t want to use a selfie, so I had to wait until I could ask someone to take my picture.

Iâ€™m no longer wearing my other glasses. I like these frames much more AND they donâ€™t make me sick. My reading glasses are a little nerdier, but I can only use them to read.

Iâ€™m happy! ðŸ˜Š
