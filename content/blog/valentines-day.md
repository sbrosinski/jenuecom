title: Valentine's Day

While the idea of a special day to celebrate romance is admirable, I don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day because I think it’s too commercial to be taken seriously.

Statistically Valentine’s Day is the day when a lot of couples break up.  It’s the day to evaluate if you really want to stay with the person that you’re currently dating.

I don’t have anything spectacular to say on the topic of romantic love. I just know that if I love you, I will say it. If I can’t say it with words, I will show it with affection. You will know that I love you! I will never regret loving someone, and I certainly will never apologize for it.

Whether you celebrate Valentine’s Day or not, I wish you all a lovely day. 💝
