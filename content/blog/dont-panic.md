Today is so beautiful that my daily coding practice almost eluded me. So, as I was reading along, I didnâ€™t fully understand what was happening with the code in question. But, as soon as I typed it into my IDE (IntelliJ) and ran the code, I could SEE what was happening. 

So that is my tip for you today. Donâ€™t immediately panic if something goes over your head. Wait at least until you run the code before you get anxious. And if you still donâ€™t understand, then contact your nearest computer scientist. ðŸ˜‰ And if s/he canâ€™t help you, then you can start panicking. ðŸ˜­
