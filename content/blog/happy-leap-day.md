I donâ€™t really have anything super intriguing to share today, but itâ€™s leap year so I wanted to post something.

I think leap day is a special because it only happens once every four years.  Iâ€™m not sure why itâ€™s so underplayed. In my opinion it deserves to be a holiday!

Today was gorgeous.  The weather forecast said most cloudy, but it was actually mostly sunny.  And it was a comfortable 12Â° C. Even though I didnâ€™t get a chance to spend a lot of time outside, I enjoyed the weather.  I had a productive day.

Fun Fact: Another word for the leap year is bissextile. ðŸ‘€ Grammar correct tried to replace it the word bisexual. Um, I will not be using this word! ðŸ«£
