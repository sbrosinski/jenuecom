My tip of the day:

Don’t let the fear of rejection stop you from trying. The feeling of “what if” or “I should have” is a lot worse than rejection. 

At least with rejection comes the comfort of knowing that you tried. And now that you’ve tried there’s nothing holding you back from moving forward. 

Rejection might hurt for a few days but missed opportunity will gnaw at your soul for a lifetime!
