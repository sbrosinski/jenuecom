# Monsters

<br/>
I’ll show you my monsters
<br/>
if you show me yours
<br/>

<br/>
Didn’t think you could outdo my plight
<br/>
but I wouldn’t want your life; wouldn’t
<br/>
put up a fight
<br/>

<br/>
You’re smarter that I, I’m not going to lie.
<br/>
So, why is your life such a far outcry?
<br/>

<br/>
I’ve never seen so many demons in a 
<br/>
single closet
<br/>
Compared to yours, my life’s a sweet 
<br/>
little sonnet.
<br/>
