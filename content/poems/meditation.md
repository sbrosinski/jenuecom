# Meditation

<br/>
A slight breeze blows across my face
<br/>
as the ocean waves crash upon the shore
<br/>

<br/>
Children race and play all day not afraid
<br/>
to explore
<br/>

<br/>
The sandy beach is full of life
<br/>
the air is fresh and clean
<br/>

<br/>
There is no strife, my mind is
<br/>
free; my meditation serene
<br/>

<br/>
This is the moment I would capture
<br/>
if time would stand still
<br/>

<br/>
There is no other time that’s finer; no
<br/>
other place with such goodwill
<br/>

<br/>
There’s nothing more which I adore
<br/>
than my meditations upon the shore
<br/>

<br/>
