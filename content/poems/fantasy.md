# Fantasy

<br/>
I fantasize about you whom I’ve never met
<br/>
Your lips are sweet and slightly wet.
<br/>

<br/>
I’ve looked into your eyes which I’ve never seen.  
<br/>
They look back at me with a shiny gleen.
<br/>

<br/>
I fantasize about you my invisible lover.
<br/>
Your touch is lightning my kisses thunder.
<br/>
