# Raindrops

I miss you so much that raindrops sing your name.<br/>
<br/>
I love you so much that sunsets bear your face. And I’m sure that at the end of every rainbow is where I left pieces of your golden heart.<br/>
<br/>
But I will not stop searching. I will not stop trying to find all the pieces of your heart, for without them I am broken.  <br/>
<br/>
Doomed to love you till the end of time. The raindrops will continue to sing your name. The sunsets will still bear your face. And I --- I will always be at the end of every rainbow, mending your golden heart.  <br/>
<br/>
Hoping. Wishing. Praying. That someday, you’ll return.  <br/>
