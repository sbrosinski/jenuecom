# Hero

The one and only time in my life that I saw someone as a hero.  He turns and calls me a whore. 

He flirted with me.  Did he forget that?

It hurt

A lot

But I remained polite. I didn’t know why he was so angry. And he wasn’t going to tell me. So, I tried to comfort him. It’s okay.  You’re okay. And now that you’ve said what you needed to say, I hope you feel better. 

Because in the end.  It doesn’t change the fact that he’s still my hero. He made me well.  Maybe he has the right to break me?

Whore

The cut of his scalpel ran deep. The bore of his drill crushed bone. But it was his words that burned a permanent scar on my heart. 

And there lies the conflict. Because how can I hate the person who saved me?

And the answer is

I can’t

He’s still my hero.
