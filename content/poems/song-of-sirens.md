Broken bottle dreams and dagger edged promises cut deep. <br/>
The song of Sirens steer my ship. <br/>
I’m helpless. <br/>
Addicted to the melody.<br/>
I need the poison. <br/>
<br/>
It’s like fire and brimstone giving me hugs and kisses. And thunder and lightning running through my veins.<br/>
It’s like waking up in hell but not wanting to go back to sleep. It’s sweet pain and the feeling of doomsday in my tummy. <br/>
It’s hate wrapped in pretty paper and sophomoric logic with brown diamond eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Lyrical lies and feel good beats move me.<br/>
Spinning all around, reality is madness. <br/>
I hum the aria.<br/>
And the chorus goes on. <br/>
<br/>
Broken bottle dreams and dagger edged promises run wide. <br/>
