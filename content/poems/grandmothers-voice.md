# Grandmother’s Voice

When I fell and bruised my knee<br/>
You didn’t kiss it and make it better.<br/>
“Get up,” you said instead.  And when<br/>
I did, I was proud I was not a quitter.<br/>
Through times of rough and troubled waters<br/>
You held me up just long enough, before throwing<br/>
Me back in.<br/>
“Swim,” you commanded and when I did, I felt<br/>
Really accomplished within.<br/>
Always austere but never foreboding, that’s how I remember <br/>
You.  With fond thoughts but an empty heart --- death has taken<br/>
You way.<br/>
But even in death I hear your voice.<br/>
“Live,” you whisper.  And in so doing it <br/>
Gives me courage traveling your pathway. <br/>
