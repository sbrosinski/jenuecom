Color me red

My cheeks are blushed

Embarrassment is something I dread

Color me green

That should have been mine

Envy can be so obscene

Color me yellow

I am afraid 

Lack of courage is so hollow

Color me blue

The shade of somber

I really don’t like that hue.

Color me white

It’s everyone’s delight

But I’m not quite that light

Color me black

It’s misunderstood

But I can relate to that.
