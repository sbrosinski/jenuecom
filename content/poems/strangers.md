# Strangers

<br/>
Like two ships passing in the 
<br/>
night we met.
<br/> 
The only difference is that 
<br/>
I didn’t forget.
<br/>

<br/>
The butterflies that were in my tummy
<br/>
as you brushed  past me ---
<br/>
your gorgeous eyes and amazing
<br/>
generosity.
<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if our paths will ever 
<br/>
cross again.  
<br/>
Is it silly that I can’t stop thinking 
<br/>
of you---my sweet friend?
<br/>
