Searching for positive attributes describing the one I used to love<br/>
but all that remains is a faint residue of leftover feelings. <br/>
Battered and bruised<br/>
Ignored and abused<br/>
A lost friendship<br/>
The love that used to burn with the fire of a thousand suns<br/>
is now just hell. <br/>
And the nicest thing that I can say about the once rhythm of my heart, <br/>
Lion of my soul, <br/>
is that I used to. <br/>
But I don’t remember why.<br/>
And all that’s left <br/>
is indifference.<br/>
