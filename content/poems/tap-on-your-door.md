# Tap On Your Door

I used to think there is no such thing as magic and then I met you.<br/>
There’s something about your smile that makes me want to smile.<br/>
You’re a stranger, but I want to make love to you in the dark. <br/>
I want to stare into your eyes.  <br/>
I want to touch your joyful heart. <br/>
<br/>
And I wonder what that makes me.<br/>
Am I foolish for ignoring all the dangers of wanting to be with a stranger? <br/>
That’s not me at all. I’m the analytical one. But you made me fall.<br/>
And I’m happily blind to the soul-crushing ache that might be.<br/>
Because I know – I know that you are kind. <br/>
<br/>
But only time will tell.<br/>
So I’ll be brave and tap on your door and if you don’t answer I’ll tap once more,
because the only thing that will cure me of wanting you -- is you.  <br/>
And it’ll be okay if you don’t want to be lovers<br/>
Because being friends at the end of the day, is the perfect way to recover.<br/>
