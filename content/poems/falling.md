# Falling

I'm stuck, I'm stumbling, I'm falling.<br/><br/>

Falling deeper and deeper into this madness.<br/><br/>

Made of nothing but of dreams and fairytales<br/>
and fabrication and lies.<br/><br/>

Made of my own consciousness and approved<br/>
by my own lunacy. <br/><br/>

The result of which is happiness and bliss and all things colorful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
