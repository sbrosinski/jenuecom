<br/><br/>
I remember you promising a night of pleasure.<br/>
I’m holding you to that.<br/>
One night is all it takes for you to breathe into me.<br/>
For me to breathe into you.<br/>
Exploring each other for the first time.<br/>
Perhaps, for the last time.<br/>
<br/>
Forever doesn’t exist.<br/>
But now is all we need<br/>
To discover what lies beneath the hard edges<br/>
And smooth curves. <br/>
Finally fitting those pieces together.<br/>
Imagine how delicious. <br/>
<br/>
Breathe into me.<br/>
You know what I like.<br/>
I know what you like.<br/>
No rules. Remember?<br/>
Let’s use one moment.<br/>
Feel into me.<br/>
<br/>
Can you see me? <br/>
I can see you.<br/>
You’re so beautiful no poetry can describe you.<br/>
You’re corn silk and baby’s breath <br/>
Thrown into a storm of car engines <br/>
And cigarettes. <br/>
<br/>
I want all your parts.<br/>
Give me the green of your eyes and the heart of your jewel. <br/>
I’ll take the good of your humor and the harsh of your anger.<br/>
Breathe into me.<br/>
Feel into me.<br/>
Come into me.<br/><br/>
