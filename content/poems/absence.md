# Absence

I didn't think that I'd miss him so<br/>I wish I'd never let him go.<br/><br/>But it's too late for might haves and<br/>should have beens.  <br/>Now I have to watch as his new life <br/>begins.<br/><br/>I have no hope that he'll return to me<br/>but I still hang on to his memory.<br/><br/>That's the only thing that fills my heart.<br/>With his memory I'll never part.<br/><br/>
