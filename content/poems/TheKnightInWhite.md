# Knight in White

<br/>
Cold steel blue eyes,<br/>
Above the mask of the knight in white.<br/>
Authoritative and powerful. His <br/>
Demeanor burning bright.<br/>
<br/>
Bold butterflies,<br/>
Around the maiden alone in plight.<br/>
Flying attentive and colorful. Her<br/>
Armor below his shining light. <br/>
<br/>
Cold steel blue eyes,<br/>
His intent she knew not.<br/>
Ominous but magnificent,<br/>
Emotions became<br/>
entangled in a knot. <br/>
<br/>
Bravery captured her heart, <br/>
Because choice she had none. <br/>
She bid his assistance<br/>
And he accepted bar none.<br/>
<br/>
Cold steel blue eyes,<br/>
Did not describe his nature.<br/>
For hidden underneath, in his<br/>
Deep interior, was a warm and<br/>
Concerning creature. <br/>
<br/>
He drew his magic sword and touched<br/>
The cheek of the damsel. <br/>
He stitched her with his hands <br/>
Leaving no trace of his scalpel. <br/>
<br/>
She was finally free of years of pain.<br/>
And the good knight in white, with<br/>
The cold blue eyes, nodded ever so<br/>
Gently and she knew he was wise.<br/>
<br/>
Kind sir, may I please know your name?<br/>
Thank you so much. Her gratitude was great and<br/>
Her heart was full and she wanted him to know<br/>
That he made her joyful.<br/>
<br/>
Pulling down his mask she finally saw his face.<br/>
Dark and handsome -- but more than that.<br/>
He leaned in and whispered his name in her ear.<br/>
Again, gratefulness filled her heart -- but a little more than that.<br/>
<br/>
Gallantly dressed in white, <br/>
The cold blue-eyed knight, who was not cold at all, bid <br/>
Farewell to the maiden, who would never forget him or<br/>
His name. She imagined him saving other young belles. <br/>
And perhaps even a dragon from his own flame. <br/>
