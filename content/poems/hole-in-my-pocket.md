# Hole In My Pocket

All I have is thirty cents, a broken string and a view of the moon.<br/>
While it’s very little, I’m glad that it didn’t fall through the hole in my pocket.<br/> 
Thirty cents -- a piece of candy, a dandelion and rainbows after a rainy day<br/>
But what shall I do with the broken string?  Take it off and throw it away<br/>
Although difficult, it’s not impossible to play <br/>
A violin who has snapped its string.<br/>
But best of all and free to all<br/>
Is the lovely moon, who lights the sky and delights the eye<br/>
And hangs around regardless of crown.<br/>
Lower class, middle class, upper class.  No matter.<br/>
The hole in my pocket is mended because<br/>
Everything with quality overcomes the quantity<br/>
of Minted. Mineral. Material.  <br/>
