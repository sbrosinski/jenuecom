<h1>One Of Them</h1>
When I saw the shiny object half hidden in the sand I was as excited as a teenager could be.  I casually picked it up.  Dusting it off revealed a lovely silver bracelet with a rather odd inscription on the inside, along with the initials MRP.<br/>
<br/>
            Many years past, but the bracelet held onto the special place that I had given it in my jewelry box.  I wore it for every special occasion so, of course, it was a part of my ensemble the first Thanksgiving that I spent with my boyfriend's family.  Paul's father greeted us at the door.<br/>
            <br/>
                        "Welcome," he offered me his hand "I'm Joe."<br/>
                        <br/>
                                    "Fran.  It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Sir."  I was so nervous.<br/>
                                    <br/>
                                                "Please, call me Joe."<br/>
                                                <br/>
                                                            "Joe," I repeated his name.<br/>
                                                            <br/>
                                                                        "Don't be nervous.  We're all friends here."  I gave him an awkward smile and was introduced to Paul's brother and sister, Leo and Jane.<br/>
                                                                        <br/>

                                                                                                <br/>

                                                                                                            <br/>

My initials replaced MRP but the inscription remained the same, "Resistance is futile." And the card simply read, "You're one of us now."
