		<p> I'm a junior accountant. I write in my spare time and I've published two short stories and three poems. English is my native language. I'm fluent in German and I'm proficient in Portuguese. My hobbies include traveling and sitting in coffee shops to watch people walk past. I, however, hate coffee.
