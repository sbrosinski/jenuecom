<div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/dream-world/">Dream World</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">3/11/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I literally woke up this morning with the sun on my face. I was happy to be awake, but slightly sad to have left a beautiful dream. What is the opposite of a nightmare? Is there a word for that? My subconscious gave me exactly what I wanted, what I craved, what I’ve been fantasizing about, in the form of a dream. And I remember every detail of it.</p>
<p>I am very thankful and happy for this gift. I hope the dream visits me again soon, but until then I’ll enjoy the sunshine. It’s such a beautiful day today. And I know that this is also a gift. 🌞</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/celebrating/">Celebrating</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">3/8/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>A year ago today, I was in the hospital getting a very difficult wisdom tooth removed. There were complications and I ended up in the heart station. But my wisdom tooth was gone! AND the surgeon managed not to break my jaw during the procedure. AND he also miraculously didn’t touch any of the surrounding nerves. AND the cardiologists couldn’t find anything wrong with my heart!</p>
<p>I dodged several bullets that day. I never considered myself a beautiful woman, so I didn’t realize how precious my face is until my doctor said that I could lose feeling in my lips, tongue, and have a huge scar from the screws that he would use to wire a broken jaw shut.</p>
<p>It was an excruciating experience, but I’m still here. So, today I’m celebrating life. I’m so happy to live a normal, simple, life completely undamaged and completely healed.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/third-person/">Autobiographies Pretending to be Biographies</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">3/3/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Yesterday I clicked on a youtube video and after I watched the video, I went to the about page to find out more about the channel. I was really surprised that the owner of the channel wrote a description in 3rd person. It just seemed really odd and out of place to me.</p>
<p>I know from experience, with publishing, that authors are often required to write their own biographies, written in the 3rd person. I’ve done it several times and it always felt dishonest to me. It felt like I was trying to trick people into believing that I was so important that someone else was writing about me. But that’s a big lie, isn’t it?  I wrote the short biography myself. And I think that most people know that I wrote it myself. So why do I need to lie?</p>
<p>I don’t like autobiographies that are pretending to be biographies. Just be honest and write in the 1st person. Autobiographies are, in my opinion, much better. You know yourself better than anyone else, so I’d rather read what YOU write about yourself.</p>
<p>Just my opinion though 🤓</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/ukraine/">Ukraine</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/26/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Love and Solidarity to the Ukraine. I can’t imagine what it’s like being invaded. I wish I could help, but all I can do is send prayers. 🙏🏼</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/details-matter/">Details Matter</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/16/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>In all fields of life details matter. People notice the little things. And it’s often the smallest details that make an otherwise mediocre work into something of excellence.</p>
<p>It’s really amazing how the smallest details can make a colossal difference. A hand placed on a shoulder can provide comfort. A smile can be encouraging. A thank you can change how people see you.</p>
<p>An extra line of code to properly document your work will be greatly appreciated, even if no one seems to care.</p>
<p>When accepting gifts people notice the wrapping. They will appreciate the hand stitched monogram and homemade items.  And even if they don’t like the actual gift, they will love that you made the extra effort.</p>
<p>Paying attention to detail can make a good dinner into a special one. The examples can go on forever. But I’ll end this post here. I love a good detail! 🤓</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/emotional-freedom/">Emotional Freedom</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/11/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I miss the free-range emotional freedom that children enjoy. They’re allowed to cry when a nurse pokes them with a needle. When they get angry no one’s stopping them from having a temper tantrum. They brutally speak without filter. They’re not afraid to say, I love you. They’re not afraid to say, I hate you. They’re allowed to be afraid and hold onto their teddy bear.</p>
<p>As an adult, you can only dream of having that much emotional freedom. I would give almost anything to show my feelings without consequences. My emotions are, however, written on my face. I never learned how to control my facial expressions. 😇</p>
<p>So, you will know if I like you without me saying a word. And, unfortunately, the opposite is also true.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/shiny-light-bulb/">Shiny Light Bulb</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/9/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>That moment when the light bulb over your head shines bright! And you finally understand the coding concept that you’ve been working on for days. Happy!!! 🥳</p>
<p>Programming concepts can really take a while to sink in. Be patient. I promise you’ll eventually understand it.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/break-the-box/">Break the Box</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/8/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>In regard to problem solving you often heard people say, think outside the box. It’s a difficult concept to imagine without taking into consideration that you will damage the box in the process. And if you succeed in finding a solution outside the box, it will never fit inside the old box.</p>
<p>My observation is that people are afraid to break the box. But that’s the whole idea, isn’t it? You’re supposed to break the box. Because by definition, an outside-the-box solution has to be bigger than the inside of the old box.</p>
<p>But that’s okay. Making bigger boxes is the easy part. So dear friends, Break the box!</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/dream/">Dream</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/6/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Last year I had to spend 5 days in the hospital because of a very difficult wisdom tooth. And ever since I’ve had a recurring dream where I’m lost in the hospital and I can’t find my way out. When I finally find an exit, my doctor is guarding the door and won’t let me leave.</p>
<p>Strange dream. I don’t like hospitals and I usually hate doctors, but this doctor is different. I like him. I trust him. I’m not afraid of him, but for some reason I always wake up when he touches my hand.</p>
<p>Then I realize that he sent me home. And even though I'm happy to be back in my own bed, I want to know what's behind the door that he was guarding. Why did I wake up when he touched my hand? I want him to escort me through the door. But so far it's always the same dream...</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/before-birth/">Before Birth</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/5/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Is there a word for the place that stores the souls/people that will be born?  I know this is a weird question. But I hear children talk about this place all the time.  They would ask, “Mommy, where was I before I was in your tummy?” And then they are really confused when their parents tell them that they were not in existence yet.</p>
<p>I’ve pondered this question and haven’t found an answer. Religion offers no clue as to where souls or people are kept before conception. It only talks about death. But if there’s a place for people who are no longer alive... Shouldn’t there also be a place for people or souls who are not yet born?</p>
<p>I think the children are right! Where is this place? What is this place? And why don’t we know about it?</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/winter-blues/">Winter Blues</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">2/3/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>It’s 44 days until the end of Winter and I’m really looking forward to Spring. Getting through Winter has always been a struggle for me due to the lack of sunlight where I live. I haven’t figured out a solid working solution yet. I take vitamin D supplements, but it really doesn’t change my mood. In the Winter I tend to feel more sad, depressed, and lonely compared to the other seasons. And I generally feel physically unwell. I know that, for me, my body and mind is directly connected with sunlight. On sunny Winter days I feel a lot better, but they are unfortunately few.</p>
<p>44 days is still a lot of days to go, so I try to keep my mind busy, my body fit, and self-soothe with comforting foods and happy music.</p>
<p>How do you survive the Winter blues?</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/real-luxury/">Real Luxury</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">1/24/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>We all need financial security and enough money for the basics and a little bit more. But, my definition of luxury includes things that can’t be bought with money. In my opinion if you can buy it with money, it’s not real luxury. Again, I’m not saying that financial security isn’t important.</p>
<p>I'm saying that you don’t have to envy your neighbour’s electric Porsche. If you look at the Porsche in terms practicality and need, you might notice that you don’t even want or need an electric Porsche at all. And if take it a step further and imagine yourself owning it, you might feel just a little bit ridiculous. Because it’s just an expensive status symbol!</p>
<p>Now count all the things that you actually have that are, in my opinion, real luxury:
Family, friends, healthy children, love, peace, safety, a sense of accomplishment, a healthy mind and body, happiness, a purpose, knowing that you’re not alone, and a fulfilling occupation.</p>
<p>If you have two or more of the luxuries on my list, then you are indeed very rich! Don’t waste your time chasing an overabundance of money just to buy unimportant things. Spend your precious time creating happy memories instead.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/verschlimmbessert/">Verschlimmbessert</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">1/22/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Verschlimmbessert is my new favorite German word! It means, when you try to make something better but end up making it worse. Yes, one word means all of that. And it’s a perfect example of German efficiency.</p>
<p>I’m wondering why I’ve never heard this word before, but I will be using it very often from now on. 😉</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/slippery-technology/">Slippery Technology</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">1/12/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I want to know the name of the tech guru responsible for making the iphone as slippery as possible.  Because the idea is actually kind of diabolical.</p>
<p>I can imagine that tech meeting going something like this:</p>
<p>I think Dr. Evil was also invited to this meeting, for whatever reason ¯_(ツ)_/¯ But his suggestion of encasing it with cactus needles 🌵 was narrowly out voted.🐈</p>
<p>Does anyone have a more subtle way of making fun of the peasants?</p>
<p>Then someone says,</p>
<p>How about we charge them lots of $$$$$ BUT let’s also make the phone as slippery as a snail’s bottom so it will fall off of every surface known to mankind and then they’ll have to spend even more $$$$$.</p>
<p>Then someone else adds,</p>
<p>AND let’s not include a phone charger any more. They can use their old chargers! OR spend even more $$$$$ replacing it.</p>
<p>YES! The peasants!!  Let them eat phone!!!!  (insert evil laugh here).</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/too-much-water/">Too Much Water</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">1/11/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I just found out that drinking 8 glasses of water a day is not only a myth, but a straight up lie. I knew it! I always thought that was too much water and could never drink that much. It’s enough to just drink when you’re thirsty. Your body knows what it needs!</p>
<p>I remember when people used to carry around water bottles like they were living in the desert. Now it just seems silly, doesn't it? 😅</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/java/">Java</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">1/8/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>A new day! The sun is shining and I’m feeling a lot better. Today is Saturday and I’ll spend a good amount of time reading “Think Java, how to think like a Computer Scientist” by Allen B. Downey &amp; Chris Mayfield.
I’m already on chapter 6 and I’ve done the exercises to this point. I was really disappointed that there are no answers to the questions in the back of the book, but it really forces me to be resourceful and that’s an important part of learning Java as well.
I do recommend this book. It’s written so a child can understand it. And the exercises are actually quite fun and challenging.
It will take me a few weeks to work through the rest of the book and I’m really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Today, I will also stop by Amigoscode on YouTube and listen to his tutorials. Check him out if you’re interested in coding. His channel has a lot of good content.</p>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I would like to only blog about happiness and sunshine but life isn’t always like that, is it?  So, today I’m going to be real with you. My soul feels like it’s on fire. I’m tired of being disappointed. I’m tired of feeling alone and invisible. 💔 But I still have hope that tomorrow will be better. Send hugs!</p>

    <p>This year has definitely been a roller coaster ride for me. At one point, I honestly didn’t think I would see 2022, so I’m really thankful to be here. I’m curious to see what the future holds and prepared for the new adventure.</p>
<p>To those of you who walked with me in 2021, I love you and wish you a Happy New Year!</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/my-languages/">The Languages I speak and Why</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/20/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I tell people that I’m a native English speaker and that’s true, but the earliest years of my life I spoke Jamaican Patios. And I still speak Patois when I’m around my extended family.</p>
<p>I speak German because it’s the language of my nuclear family.</p>
<p>I learned Portuguese because my favorite vacation spot is the Algarve in Portugal. There’s something about Portugal that just feels like home. So, I adopted the language.</p>
<p>Romanian is new. It’s the native language of the talented surgeon who, literally, saved my face. He’s my hero! It’s quite overwhelming knowing that I’ll never be able to pay him back, so I’m learning his language. And just like the other 3 languages, I’ll call it my own and hold it close to my heart. ❤️</p>
<p>I will never consider myself smart because I’m multilingual. Anyone can learn a language! And in Europe it is expected that everyone speaks at least one foreign language.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/covid-frustration/">Covid Frustration in Germany</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/19/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I’m vaccinated for Covid with Biontech. They tell me that I need a booster. Okay, I’m willing to get a booster shot with Biontech because that’s what I was vaccinated with. But now they’re telling me that I can’t have Biontech because I’m over 30; they don’t have enough and Moderna is just as good.</p>
<p>No, I don’t want Moderna. And if Moderna was just as good as Biontech they would have no problem at all giving it to people under 30 years old.</p>
<p>I would even offer to pay for the Biontech booster, but I don’t think that’s an option.</p>
<p>So, I guess I’m taking my chances with Omicron. I refuse to get vaccinated with an inferior vaccine just because there isn’t enough of the good stuff.</p>
<p>This whole situation just feels wrong.</p>
<p>Update:  31-12-2021</p>
<p>Today I was vaccinated with Biontech! Apparently, the rule is not set in stone. I went to the vaccination center and the Doctor just asked people what they wanted. Easy peasy, no fuss. So, if you’re over 30 and they refuse to give you Biontech I would recommend that you just go somewhere else.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/learning-code/">Learning Code</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/18/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Coding is exactly like learning a language and since I speak 4 languages, I’m hoping to polish my coding skills quickly. Trial and error is key. Practice. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Sometimes you might even want to make mistakes on purpose just to see what errors you will get.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the task</li>
<li>Start with what you know in Main</li>
<li>Debug as you go along</li>
<li>Build your code little by little</li>
<li>Document your code</li>
</ul>
<p>Coding is also like writing a story. Other programmers should be able to look at your code and know what you are trying to do. Practice the jargon so you can communicate concisely with other programmers. Towards the end of the initial learning phase, coding will become more and more a team effort and communication will be essential.</p>

    <span class="blogDate">12/17/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Yesterday, after dinner, I ate a tiny piece of mango and then immediately threw up. There was nothing wrong with the mongo. I shared the mango with my family and none of them got sick.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time I threw up from fruit, but I don’t think it’s an allergy. You see, I’ve noticed that if I eat fruit first (and have nothing else) it stays in my tummy. I don’t get sick.  But if I eat fruit after a meal, it will make me throw up.</p>
<p>The fruits that have made me throw up include: mangos, bananas, pears, and grapes. Apparently, I can eat these fruits individually but not together with other foods.</p>
<p>Isn’t that the strangest thing? Has anyone else experienced this with fruit? I didn’t think that such a small piece of mango would make me throw up, but I was wrong!</p>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Pressing On</p>
<p>I find myself in the uncomfortable situation of having no plans for the future. I had a plan, at least I thought I had a plan. And then someone told me that even if I reach my goal, I would still have to do X-Y-Z to move forward.</p>
<p>The discouragement was devastating. I stopped and did nothing at all.  The only thing that I accomplished this year was getting my bad wisdom tooth removed. It was a horrible experience. I somehow ended up in the heart station of the hospital because I had trouble waking up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish that I hadn’t. Then at least I wouldn’t have to figure out what to do with my life. ~ <em>Deep Breath</em> ~  I have no choice but to press on. Without encouragement. Without support. Hoping that somehow, I’ll be okay.</p>
<p>And you know, I think I will be. I don’t break so easily.  It’s time to move forward. If no one believes in you, you have to believe in yourself. And on my journey, I will be a source of encouragement and sunshine for others. 🌞🌻</p>

    <p>I’m curious why 9 people clicked on the same story? I wrote “The Lucky Card” in 2006, so it’s kind of weird that so many people are interested in the story now.</p>
<p>I got the idea for that story because several people told me that I’m a good luck charm. They were convinced that good things happen to them when I’m standing nearby. Funny, right?</p>
<p>Anywho, if you have questions please ask. My e-mail address is on the landing page. I usually answer my messages in a timely and friendly manner.</p>

    <p>Gift Giving</p>
<p>I love giving gifts! And the gift giving season is indeed upon us. If I give you a gift it’s because I love you, or I want to say thank you, or both. You will know why. 😉</p>
<p>But as much as I love giving gifts, I’m also very cautious about doing so. The whole gift giving process can get a little political. For example, what is an expensive gift? What is a cheap gift?
I think you know where I’m going with this post. What’s expensive for one person, may not be expensive for the other. And you might not share my opinion about what’s cheap. As a rule, if you are not close friends, a gift should fall in between expensive and cheap. But that can be a little tricky.</p>
<p>For example, good perfume is always expensive. But I could never give an adult cheap perfume. I’d rather not give anything at all. The same concept goes for jewelry. I mean, why would I give someone that I like something that will turn their hand green? I won’t!  So, what do I do? If I’m not allowed to give a person an expensive gift, then I stay away from perfume and jewelry.</p>
<p>Giving someone a ridiculously cheap gift is always a big NO for me. But there are many times when giving expensive gifts is inappropriate. For example, giving an expensive gift to your child’s teacher… BIG NO for obvious reasons. Also, giving expensive gifts to those who might feel obligated to give you a gift in return is a no.</p>
<p>With all this said, here is a list of gifts that I like to give:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebooks or journals</li>
<li>Scarfs and gloves</li>
<li>Chocolates</li>
<li>A nice pen</li>
<li>Unisex beaded bracelets</li>
<li>Homemade jar of cookies</li>
<li>Gift baskets: Food or Cosmetics</li>
<li>Bath bombs or salts</li>
<li>A nice silver brooch (for women)</li>
<li>Silver cufflinks or tie pins (for men)</li>
<li>Blankets</li>
<li>Fancy coffees and Teas</li>
<li>Coffee or tea mugs</li>
</ul>
<p>Gifts that I love getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugs and Kisses 🥰</li>
<li>Compliments (Yes, please flatter me) 😅</li>
<li>Chocolates</li>
<li>Socks (Because I always have holes in mine)</li>
<li>Home-baked goods</li>
<li>Keepsakes (like Christmas ornaments)</li>
<li>Gift baskets</li>
<li>Plants and flowers</li>
</ul>

    <span class="blogDate">12/7/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I spend so much time chasing unattainable rainbows that I’ve been missing out on enjoying the stars that I’ve caught. I usually don’t make new year’s resolutions but this year I’ll make an exception.  So here goes… I’m officially declaring my New Year’s resolution:</p>
<p>I will make my best effort to spend more time in the moment, appreciating and enjoying what I have.</p>
<p>Now that it is written, it shall be done! 😂</p>
<p>I’ll still be chasing rainbows and butterflies, because that’s who I am. But if I can spend more time in the moment and less time chasing, I’ve already won.</p>
<p>Do you have a New Year’s resolution?</p>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>In my family St. Nick’s Day is special. And I would like to extend my cheer to all of you. May your hearts be filled with joy and warmth during this cold winter season.</p>
<p>I know that the holidays can be sad, stressful, and difficult. If you’re having a hard time right now just remember:</p>
<p>Everything passes</p>
<p>Keep breathing</p>
<p>Someone loves you (and you might not even know it)</p>
<p>You’re made of stardust!</p>

    <span class="blogDate">11/26/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I made these ascii hugs and kisses Christmas trees and would like to share them with you.
Just copy and paste. If the tree doesn’t paste completely in alignment you will have to
adjust the spacing. Works really well in g-mail and looks amazing if you add color. So
if you're tired of using the same old emojis give this a go. Tis the Season!</p>

    <span class="blogDate">11/25/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Happy Thanksgiving to all of you who celebrate it. I live in Europe so today’s just a normal workday for me. When I lived in the United States my Caribbean family celebrated with traditional Caribbean food.</p>
<p>My mother used to get all her ingredients from a little Asian shop on Old World 3rd Street. The shop owner, a sweet little ancient and wise man, always had everything we needed. He even had canned ackee and Cock flavored soup mix. And for those of you who don’t know, stop laughing, it’s not what you think. Just google it!</p>
<p>Anywho, don’t forget to be thankful and create lots of good memories. Try to enjoy the little annoyances because someday you’ll look back and realize that these were the good ole days.</p>
<p>Be the sunshine. 🦃  Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/back-to-blogging/">Back to Blogging</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">11/15/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>A lot of people have left social media and I’m one of them. In my opinion social media is doing more harm than good. I’ve been social media free for about 3 years and it was the best decision for my mental health and productivity. I kept Youtube for watching videos, but that’s it.</p>
<p>It has been quite a while since I’ve had a blog and now that I’m not on social media anymore I realize that I miss it. This will be my little corner on the internet where I journal my journey through life without oversharing, without likes, without followers and without fake friends. There will be no stalking and no nonsense here!</p>
<p>At this point in my life I find myself going back to coding. And this is where I will chart my progress, writing down what I’ve learned and how I’ve learned it because it might be helpful to someone else. This is also where I will post holiday greetings and spread sunshine.</p>
<p>More sunshine, more flowers, more power! You’re welcome to stay a while and vibe with me.</p>
