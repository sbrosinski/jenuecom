    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I woke up this morning and watched the successful launch of Artemis 1. 🚀</p>
<p>I was 11 years old when I watched the Challenger explode, live on TV, while I was sitting in class. We were all horrified. A whole crew of astronauts just died. After our teacher got over the initial shock, he led us in prayer.</p>
<p>Ever since, I cringe at rocket launches. Even the ones without a crew. But Artemis was a beautiful sight to see.</p>
<p>Nasa's tie cutting tradition is very cool! ✂️ 👔</p>

    <span class="blogDate">11/10/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I was recently accused of being cynical. A friend wanted to take a walk, but it was already dark outside, so I told her that it wasn’t a good idea. And that started a whole discussion. Why isn’t it a good idea for women to take a walk after dark?</p>
<p>While I adore my friend's childlike view of the world, experience has taught me that it’s made up of more than just butterflies and rainbows. Taking precaution isn’t cynical, it’s common sense. And due to the nature of nature, sometimes women need to have a little more common sense than men.</p>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I haven’t posted in a while because I’ve settled in my new routine and life is just repeating itself right now. But there’s a coziness in monotony that’s predictable and safe. I’m enjoying the fall colors, the cooler temperatures, and the slow disappearance of annoying summer insects. And as Mother Nature prepares for winter, which is not my favorite time of year, I'm reminded that there’s beauty in every season. 🍁🍃🍂</p>

    <p>Hoping for something that is plausible and possible is a good thing. But in my experience not all hope is good.</p>
<p>Hoping for something that will never happen because it’s logically and scientifically impossible, is false hope. It will ultimately crush your soul.</p>
<p>Avoid it!</p>

<p>And let’s not forget the bowl of jelly trying to skinny shame you.</p>

    <p>Tonight I'm going to see Moonchild! I'm really looking forward to a night out. It's been quite a while since I've been to a concert. Many years ago I saw Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child. And both concerts were quite memorable.</p>
<p>If I take a good picture I'll post it tomorrow. 📸</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/my-name/">My Name</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">9/4/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Let’s talk about my name. My name is difficult because it’s very unusual. But there are a few other Jenue’s out there.</p>
<p>The way that I pronounce my name is JEN-you. And yes, it is my real name. It’s on my birth certificate!</p>
<p>Growing up my family called me by my yard name. That’s a Jamaican thing. It’s a nickname that your family gives you, that may or may not be related to your real name. My yard name is not related to my first name at all!  So, I didn’t know my real name until 8th grade when my Pastor needed it for confirmation.</p>
<p>I was surprised! I had absolutely no idea that Jenue was my name and I didn’t start using it until High School. My extended family still doesn’t call me Jenue. I weed people out based on what they call me.</p>
<p>If someone calls me on the telephone and asks for Jenue and pronounces it correctly, I know it’s a friend. If they ask for **** I know it’s a close relative. If they ask for Frau Brosinski, I know it’s either work, school, or medically related.</p>
<p>My nuclear family doesn’t use my name at all. They usually just start speaking when I answer the phone. Or, they call me a term of endearment. 💕🧸</p>
<p>This is just a side note, but my mom spelled my name wrong. It was supposed to be Jenu, without the silent e. Jenu is from the Kannada language and it means honey. It is pronounced Jay-nu.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/silence/">Silence</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">8/26/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>My best friend talks constantly. Once I asked her why she talks so much, and she said that she feels uncomfortable when it’s quiet. That’s the exact opposite of me. I don’t talk very much. I, of course, speak more to my friends and family, but in general I’m a quiet person.</p>
<p>I like silence. I’m often annoyed by my friend’s talking. And she tends to repeat herself. But she’s my best friend! Flamingo, if you ever read this post, I love you!!!</p>
<p>But please shut up sometimes!️ 🤫 🥰</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/todays-communte/">Today&#39;s Commute</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">8/24/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Today on my commute I saw a blind lady, with her probing cane, walking down the stairs to the train. I was walking the same direction. When she reached the bottom of the stairs a little boy took her hand. He looked at me for a second and smiled. He was not blind. Then he went to the man standing directly behind his mother, who was also blind, and he guided his father’s left hand onto his mother’s shoulder.</p>
<p>I watched, in amazement, as he led his family into the train. I would guess that the little boy is only about seven years old. And judging from his backpack, he was on his way to school.</p>
<p>Oh wow, imagine if both your parents are blind. It’s inspiring how they take care of each other.</p>
<p>Seeing this makes all of my problems seem insignificant. If you're reading this, I wish you a wonderful day. Be amazing!</p>

    <span class="blogDate">8/20/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>A lamb was saved by a mysterious stranger and now must repay his debt by starting a cult with loyal woodland followers who worship “the one who waits.”  He ventures out into regions of monsters to earn items and new followers for his cult.</p>
<p>He has to take care of his cult members basic needs, or they will die. Make sure they don’t lose faith. Take care of his village, and sometimes even make sacrifices.</p>
<p>This game can get delightfully evil. Give it a go!</p>

    <span class="blogDate">8/19/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Today the interruptions are relentless! It takes me at least 10 minutes to get in “the zone” where I’m coding and debugging comfortably. And if someone interrupts my concentration, usually for a stupid reason, I need another 10 minutes to find my focus again.</p>
<p>10 minutes there, 10 minutes here, it all adds up to an unproductive day.</p>

    <p>I use YouTube mainly as a source of learning. But it’s also filled with lots of videos that I’m not interested in. So, I NEVER scroll through the feed. It’s just a nightmare of random videos I don’t want to watch.</p>
<p>Instead, I scroll through my subscriptions or use the search bar.</p>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I only wanted what you are able to give me. And if nothing is all you have to give then I will gladly accept it, because even nothing is something.</p>
<p>It’s the memory of me falling into your eyes, and you falling into mine.</p>
<p>It’s the tension that wrapped us together and pushed us off the cliff.</p>
<p>It’s letting go to save ourselves, and realizing that we’re falling up.</p>
<p>It’s seeing you happy.</p>
<p>Your gift of nothing is precious.</p>
<p>It’s knowing that you flew away - close to me.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/love-is/">Love is...</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">8/16/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I’m tired of hearing people say love hurts. No, it doesn’t! It’s not love that hurt you.</p>
<p>The idea that love hurts is very dangerous. Don’t let anyone hurt you! 🚫</p>
<p>Love alone is not enough to sustain a healthy relationship. You need compatibility, financial security, tolerance, will power, and the ability to compromise.</p>
<p>Sharing your life with someone is very difficult. But please don’t equate hurting with love.</p>
<p>This Bilbe verse tells us what love is.</p>
<p>New International Version <br/>
1 Corinthians 13:4-7 <br/>
4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p>
<p>Nowhere in that verse does it say, love hurts.</p>

    <span class="blogDate">8/15/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>One of the bittersweet things in life is that you’re constantly meeting people who will only stay in your life short term.</p>
<p>You won’t realize what an impact they will have on you. But 10 years down the road, you will remember them and smile because they’ve taught you a lesson.</p>
<p>I used to work at a bank. My team consisted of 5 people. All with their own unique characters. They were all really amazing in their own right. The oldest member of the team was labeled as lazy. But looking back, I don’t think he was lazy at all. He was just very wise.</p>
<p>The bank system would crash every other week, and this caused a lot of chaos. This meant dealing with angry customers, unbalanced registers, and longer hours at work to manually fix everything that should have been done automatically.</p>
<p>We would all freak out! But this gentleman wasn’t one bit bothered. His level of calm during the storm made him seem lazy. But he always got his work done regardless. I remember someone confronting him about his nonchalance, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, “The building didn’t burn down.” 😎</p>
<p>Now, when things get chaotic in my life I just remember – The building didn’t burn down.</p>

    <span class="blogDate">8/14/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Real photo albums have a big advantage over digital photo albums simply because they are easily accessible to everyone, not just you.</p>
<p>The other day a friend was visiting. She wanted to see pictures of an event, but at that moment I didn’t have access to them. They were safely saved somewhere online, and I couldn’t remember the password.</p>
<p>After my guest left, I recovered my pictures! But losing digital pictures probably happen more often than it should. What if someone dies and s/he is the only one who knows where the pictures are saved? And even if you figure out where the pictures are, how will you know the password?</p>
<p>In our digital world it might seem old-fashioned and backwards, but printing special occasion pictures is extremely important.</p>

    <p>Amazing! Some people willingly go deep down the rabbit hole only to discover that all their assumptions are wrong. And then they’re angry with the rabbit.</p>
<p>Please get out of the rabbit hole. Stop stalking. Stop bullying. I hope you find peace and happiness❣️</p>
<p>Enjoy your summer 🌻</p>

    <p>I’m mostly on time. In fact, I’m usually ten minutes early to my appointments. But I’ve noticed that for some people being “on time” is directly related to how far they live from their destination.</p>
<p>The closer they live to their place of employment or school, the more likely it is that they’re late. It’s a little counterintuitive, but I think I understand the reasoning behind it.</p>
<p>When you live close to your destination, you think you have more time than you actually do, and this results in habitual tardiness.</p>
<p>Have you noticed this with your peers or even yourself? Does this phenomenon have a name? 🤔</p>

<p>If you have ever studied music, you know where that sentence comes from. During my childhood years my mom thought she could make me musical.</p>
<p>Haha! I remember being completely frustrated trying to make my side flute make some sort of noise. Holy crap! If you don’t place it on your lips just right, it makes absolutely no sound. And then once I did manage to make sound, the long notes killed me. It seemed that I could never hold my breath long enough.</p>
<p>Then I took piano lessons and was bored out of my mind. I just didn’t want to.</p>
<p>As an adult, I figured out that I really like the ukulele. I own a tenor ukulele and it makes the most beautiful sound, even when I hit the wrong notes. I tell myself that if I get really good at playing, I might try playing the guitar. But that’s a big if!

    <p>Studying today feels like a déjà vu. I’ve done this before!  The first time I went to university I majored in Business and minored in Management Information Systems. So, I took a lot of computer science classes. I graduated in ´98.</p>
<p>And now 1000 years later 😵‍💫 I’m right back where I started. Standing on the threshold of a German University. I have mixed feelings about having to start over. But the circumstances are different. Different country. Different language. Different time period. New adventure! And I welcome the 2nd chance.</p>

<p>Deep Breath. The library inside my head reminds me of this:</p>
<p>During a stay at hotel Marriott Courtyard, in Oberpfaffenhofen, I met a lady from Bangladesh. Chance placed us next to each other at breakfast. Our initial hellos and good morning turned into a mini conversation. I discovered that she was in Germany to take a course. That piqued my interest, so I probed for more information and found out that she was working for the British Navy.</p>
<p>Wow! Just wow. She was so nice and charming and humble.  I’m going to take a hint from whatever higher power that placed us next to each other and keep pressing on. My road might involve a series of failure. But that’s Okay!</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe this time they’ll say yes.</p>
<p>The poem is called Hero. I unfortunately can’t post it yet because I’ve submitted it. But I’ll post it in the near future once the reviewing process is over.</p>

    <p>Too much of anything is never a good thing, including money. It’ s my observation that wealthy people are often miserable.</p>

    <span class="blogDate">7/5/2022</span>

    <p>I think a lot of people would describe me as exotic. People have trouble placing me on the map. And when I look in the mirror I can understand why. I’m multi-cultural and that can be confusing.</p>
<p>Because I’m “exotic” people make all kinds of assumptions about me. And I think the number one assumption is that I’m hyper-sexual. Hmm… what do I say about that?</p>
<p>The truth is, I’m no more sexual than any other woman. I value friendship and kindheartedness the most. I’m attracted to a brilliant mind. I like to learn about people. I like risk takers and people who travel the road not taken. I admire those who are softspoken but fiercely bold. And if you're none of these things, or just one of these things, you will NOT get an invitation to my bed!</p>
<p>I laugh at any man, brilliant or otherwise, who assumes that he can have sex with me because I’m exotic. Or because I said, “hello.”</p>

    <p>My tip of the day:</p>
<p>Don’t let the fear of rejection stop you from trying. The feeling of “what if” or “I should have” is a lot worse than rejection.</p>
<p>At least with rejection comes the comfort of knowing that you tried. And now that you’ve tried there’s nothing holding you back from moving forward.</p>

<p>Be compassionate. Be tolerant. And do no harm.</p>

    <p>Social media is a big fat lie. Because even the sincerest people will subconsciously represent themselves online as the person they want and aspire to be, instead of who they really are.</p>
<p>And yes, that applied to me as well. Once I realized what I was doing I was devastated with an appropriate amount of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that you should leave social media. I know that’s not an option for everyone. And I also know that social media can be used for good things. But in most situations the bad side of social media outweighs the good. Just be mindful of the half truths that live on social networks.</p>

    <p>One of the funny things about me is that I’m really bad at small talk. How do I practice that? Anyway, I usually say inappropriate things to people. Like once an acquaintance proudly showed me a newborn baby. I asked who’s baby it was and she was a little offended. Oops! I never noticed she was pregnant.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>Once at a family gathering, I kindly offered to help an older lady find her missing earring. Only to find out that she only wore one earring! Oh boy!!! I was so embarrassed. 😩</p>
<p>Then there was this time I tried to make small talk with this lady and commented that her hair was different only to find out that she was being treated for breast cancer. My heart broke! 💔</p>

    <p>This morning my doorbell rang at about 7 a.m.  I’m still asleep because it’s Saturday, but I’m expecting packages, so I quickly roll out of bed and open the door. When the delivery guy said, “I have a package for your neighbor,” I almost cursed him out. Oh, my goodness, why!</p>
<p>And when my neighbor picked up his package, he said that the delivery person never rang his doorbell. 🙄</p>

<p>Did you think of a verb that doesn’t require time?</p>
<p>Well, if you didn’t then please learn some of the basic keyboard shortcuts. This really has very little to do with programming. But it’s still noteworthy knowledge.</p>

    <p>I don’t know how to delete a course on Duolingo once it’s added. I have German, Portuguese, French, and Romanian.</p>
<p>I don’t speak French at all. I added the course because I was curious and then decided it wasn’t for me. I don’t like that in French the words aren’t written like they sound.</p>
<p>I don’t speak Romanian either. I do, however, love this language. The structure is quite unique, and the sound of the language is so welcoming that it’s fun to learn. I unfortunately don’t have the time right now to invest in a new language.</p>
<p>I speak German. My grammar is not the best, but I can understand 95% of Hochdeutsch and I can speak fluently enough to be understood.</p>
<p>I understand simple Portuguese. I think that I can speak enough to get by, and I can read Portuguese very well.</p>
<p>I spent years in High School and College learning Spanish, but I don’t remember any of it. If I have time someday, maybe I’ll revisit this language.</p>
<p>So in all transparency, that's what's up on my Duolingo! 😉</p>
<p>I must also say that if you’re really adamant on becoming fluent in a language Duolingo will not be enough. You will need a few other resources to achieve fluency.</p>

    <p>I don’t usually notice a lot of spam mail because most of it gets trapped in the spam folder and the few that manage to get into my inbox gets marked and ignored. So, spam mail doesn’t bother me.</p>
<p>What does bother me is getting scam phone calls. Two members of my family have gotten the Europol scam phone call. And it was upsetting because when they hung up, the scammers called back from a different number.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you get a call from people claiming to be from Europol please just hang up and don’t answer phone numbers that you don’t know, at least for the remainder of that day. Unless you’re a hardcore criminal, the chances of Europol calling you is null. It was also a big red flag that they immediately started the conversation in English.</p>

<p><strong>Ask for help!</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people are afraid to ask for help. Don’t be!</p>
<p>Ask the right questions.</p>
<p>Ask for directions to help you solve your project. Don’t expect another developer to do your job for you. There’s a big difference.</p>
<p>Also, if one person can’t or won’t help you, ask someone else. And don’t be afraid to be just a little bit annoying. Someone will help you. CS is about team work!</p>

    <p>I woke up this morning and it’s snowing! What happened to Spring? It looks like a winter wonderland outside.</p>
<p>Anywho, my tip of the day is: Don’t waste a minute of your existence trying to make someone like you.</p>
<p>First of all, this lesson is easier said than done. But when someone’s heart is set to cold, it’s best to just leave it alone! If your boss doesn’t like you then you have to stay out of his way. Do your job well and let your work speak for itself.  The same thing applies to a teacher, object of affection, hero, or the cool kid who you admire so much.</p>
<p>I know it hurts. And if I’m being honest, I still make this mistake. It’s a really difficult lesson because you think maybe if you stay later at work, or do extra credit, or give this girl flowers… No! It never works. They will still find some reason not to like you. Save yourself some pain.</p>
<p>Find people who appreciate you for you! And feel no animosity towards those who don’t like you. That takes too much energy. Give your energy, instead, to people who know your value.</p>

    <span class="blogDate">3/30/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Let’s start with Will Smith. Oh boy!  There were children watching their “hero” being less than heroic. And for what? Because he didn’t like what someone else said. Since when are we so soft? Now the children think that it’s Ok to slap someone.</p>
<p>I once heard a girl being offended because someone complimented her. I was among her entourage, so I asked why she was so unnerved by it. She said that a compliment from someone undesirable is no compliment; it’s the opposite. Her answer was really confusing to me, because it didn’t make sense. And it still doesn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>But I realize that this is how some people feel. If you’re not pretty, young, smart, cool, etc. then they will be offended, even if you worship the ground they walk on. Because they don’t like you and how dare you have the audacity to “like” them. They’re basically offended by your existence.</p>
<p>I think this line of thinking is utter bullshit! But I’ve experienced this very thing. I offended someone just because I was a little bit too appreciative. At first, I couldn’t really figure out why I was being shunned and then it hit me. Heartbroken!</p>
<p>But what can you do? Chris Rock was just telling a joke. And he meant no ill will at all. Yet, he was slapped. I was literally just saying thank you because someone helped me out in a way that one else could. And I was shunned.</p>
<p>People will take offence to any, and everything. I’m done being bothered by it. If you’re offended by my good intentions and my good will, then that’s your problem!</p>

    <p>Today is so beautiful that my daily coding practice almost eluded me. So, as I was reading along, I didn’t fully understand what was happening with the code in question. But, as soon as I typed it into my IDE (IntelliJ) and ran the code, I could SEE what was happening.</p>
<p>So that is my tip for you today. Don’t immediately panic if something goes over your head. Wait at least until you run the code before you get anxious. And if you still don’t understand, then contact your nearest computer scientist. 😉 And if s/he can’t help you, then you can start panicking. 😭</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/a-day-at-the-office/">A day at the Office</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">3/28/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Let’s talk about something you won’t learn in your computer science class. The goal of this article is to answer the question, what does a computer scientist do? What can I expect at my first internship? How are tasks distributed?</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fact that a programmer, who is hired at an IT company or works in the IT department, seldom works alone. In your computer science class you almost always code by yourself. But in the real working world you will be part of a team.  Work will be divided among you.</p>
<p>You will be delegated a ticket. A ticket is a description of a task that needs to be done. Tickets can come from within the IT department. For example, one of your team members may notice a bug. Or, a ticket can be a request from outside the IT department. For example, from another department within your company or even a customer request.</p>
<p>Tickets are written and then put in backlog to be delegated and discussed at planning meetings. In this meeting tickets are picked for a two-week period. A two-week cycle of a project or work is called a sprint.</p>
<p>When a programmer is complete with a ticket. S/he will write code to automate a test for his own work. So completely a ticket is usually a two-step process.  You complete the task of the ticket and then you will test it (automated).</p>
<p>A green test is a working test.</p>
<p>A red test is a failed test.</p>
<p>After a successful green test, the developer will ask for a PR or Pull Request.  A pull request is a request for another developer to review and approve your code.</p>
<p>Once approved your pull request will be merged into the Main branch.</p>
<p>Developers work in branches. A branch is a copy of the code that the team is working on.</p>
<p>Sometimes when two developers change the same line of code you get a merge conflict. In this case a reviewer will look at the changes and decide which one is best.</p>
<p>This is what a developer does in a nutshell. Your computer science class will only teach you how to code, but there is so much more to being a computer scientist than just coding. It involves a lot of teamwork, a lot of communication, more meetings than you think is necessary, and twice as much problem-solving skills. And let’s not even talk about deadlines and being on call.</p>
<p>But at the end of day, if you love what you do, it’s all worth it!</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/how-to-learn-coding/">How to Learn Coding</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">3/26/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I’m actually a lot disappointed with myself that my coding skills has not improved to any significant degree in the last months.</p>
<p>But I have a plan to change that. You see, I would often get stuck on a concept for weeks and wouldn’t dare to move on until I think that I’m at an expert level of understanding.</p>
<p>That was, of course, wrong! Some concepts I will understand immediately, and other concepts will need practice. But that doesn’t mean that I should stand still and not move forward. Initially, learning to code will be memorizing a series of steps that include instructions on how to perform certain tasks. You will need to memorize the basics! But you can’t possibly memorize everything.</p>
<p>In time and with practice you will automatically remember the code you need. It’s more important for you to know how to look up information. It’s kind of like not knowing how to spell a certain word. What do you do? Well, you just look the word up in a dictionary. It’s the same with coding. If there is something you don’t know how to do or have forgotten, you need to know how to look those things up. That’s what stack overflow is for.</p>
<p>Also, don’t beat yourself up if your code doesn’t work the first time you run it. No one’s code works the first time they run it. Fixing bugs is a big part of programming. Get used to it.</p>
<p>Also, spend some time learning the work jargon. It’s impossible to know everything, but you still need to sound literate and knowledgeable when discussing issues with other programmers.</p>
<p>Spend more of your spare time tinkering with code! There is a lot of trial and error when it comes to coding. And the best programmers like to tinker and play around with code in their spare time.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I think that I live in an age where being nice is considered creepy. If you’re too nice people think you want something from them. But why? Why is it weird to be nice? I really don’t understand it.</p>
<p>I smile at people to make myself approachable.</p>
<p>I’m helpful because I like to make people happy.</p>
<p>And I like making people happy because it makes me feel good.</p>
<p>I say thank you and please because manners matter. Politeness is underrated!</p>
<p>It feels good to be nice. If you don’t believe me, do a random act of kindness and see how it makes you feel.</p>
<p>I wonder if nice people live longer? I think the physical effects of being nice has real medicinal properties. Someone should do a study on this. Nice people vs. Mean people, who lives longer. What do you think? 🤔</p>

    <p>Someone asked me what’s wrong and I said, “Nothing, I’m just busy in my head,” and their reaction was laughter. That puzzled me.  But I get that a lot.</p>
<p>When I’m thinking I stare out into the distance, stare at the wall or stare out the window.  I don’t know what that looks like to other people. I think I might look a bit stressed or worried. I really don’t know, but it seems to cause concern.</p>
<p>But I’m fine. I’m just thinking. Most of the time I’m just thinking about my day. Or, I’m planning for something. I like to go inside the attic of my head and plan and find archived information. Sometimes I just like to go there and relax. It’s my own personal library of memories. I can remember the smallest details of years past, like the names of the people from my kindergarten class.</p>
<p>I think I must look really weird sometimes. As if I’m there, but not there at the same time. I’m just busy in my head. And no, you may not ask me what I’m thinking. I hate that question. My thoughts are private, just like your thoughts are private. And unless you’re very close to me, access to my head will be politely denied.</p>

    <p>I’m usually a very decisive person, but like all people I have my indecisive moments. On these occasions I just ask myself, “if I’m going to die tomorrow…”</p>
<p>If I’m going to die tomorrow, what would I like for lunch?</p>
<p>If I’m going to die tomorrow, should finish reading this book?</p>
<p>If I’m going to die tomorrow, should I clean my apartment?</p>
<p>If I’m going to die tomorrow, should I cut my hair?</p>
<p>It’s amazing how “if I’m going to die tomorrow” will show you what you really want and need. So if you’re having a moment of indecisiveness just use this little prompt. 😉</p>

    <p>I literally woke up this morning with the sun on my face. I was happy to be awake, but slightly sad to have left a beautiful dream. What is the opposite of a nightmare? Is there a word for that? My subconscious gave me exactly what I wanted, what I craved, what I’ve been fantasizing about, in the form of a dream. And I remember every detail of it.</p>
<p>I am very thankful and happy for this gift. I hope the dream visits me again soon, but until then I’ll enjoy the sunshine. It’s such a beautiful day today. And I know that this is also a gift. 🌞</p>

    <p>A year ago today, I was in the hospital getting a very difficult wisdom tooth removed. There were complications and I ended up in the heart station. But my wisdom tooth was gone! AND the surgeon managed not to break my jaw during the procedure. AND he also miraculously didn’t touch any of the surrounding nerves. AND the cardiologists couldn’t find anything wrong with my heart!</p>
<p>I dodged several bullets that day. I never considered myself a beautiful woman, so I didn’t realize how precious my face is until my doctor said that I could lose feeling in my lips, tongue, and have a huge scar from the screws that he would use to wire a broken jaw shut.</p>
<p>It was an excruciating experience, but I’m still here. So, today I’m celebrating life. I’m so happy to live a normal, simple, life completely undamaged and completely healed.</p>

    <span class="blogDate">3/3/2022</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Yesterday I clicked on a youtube video and after I watched the video, I went to the about page to find out more about the channel. I was really surprised that the owner of the channel wrote a description in 3rd person. It just seemed really odd and out of place to me.</p>
<p>I know from experience, with publishing, that authors are often required to write their own biographies, written in the 3rd person. I’ve done it several times and it always felt dishonest to me. It felt like I was trying to trick people into believing that I was so important that someone else was writing about me. But that’s a big lie, isn’t it?  I wrote the short biography myself. And I think that most people know that I wrote it myself. So why do I need to lie?</p>
<p>I don’t like autobiographies that are pretending to be biographies. Just be honest and write in the 1st person. Autobiographies are, in my opinion, much better. You know yourself better than anyone else, so I’d rather read what YOU write about yourself.</p>
<p>Just my opinion though 🤓</p>

    <p>In all fields of life details matter. People notice the little things. And it’s often the smallest details that make an otherwise mediocre work into something of excellence.</p>
<p>It’s really amazing how the smallest details can make a colossal difference. A hand placed on a shoulder can provide comfort. A smile can be encouraging. A thank you can change how people see you.</p>
<p>An extra line of code to properly document your work will be greatly appreciated, even if no one seems to care.</p>
<p>When accepting gifts people notice the wrapping. They will appreciate the hand stitched monogram and homemade items.  And even if they don’t like the actual gift, they will love that you made the extra effort.</p>

    <p>I miss the free-range emotional freedom that children enjoy. They’re allowed to cry when a nurse pokes them with a needle. When they get angry no one’s stopping them from having a temper tantrum. They brutally speak without filter. They’re not afraid to say, I love you. They’re not afraid to say, I hate you. They’re allowed to be afraid and hold onto their teddy bear.</p>
<p>As an adult, you can only dream of having that much emotional freedom. I would give almost anything to show my feelings without consequences. My emotions are, however, written on my face. I never learned how to control my facial expressions. 😇</p>
<p>So, you will know if I like you without me saying a word. And, unfortunately, the opposite is also true.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    <p>In regard to problem solving you often heard people say, think outside the box. It’s a difficult concept to imagine without taking into consideration that you will damage the box in the process. And if you succeed in finding a solution outside the box, it will never fit inside the old box.</p>
<p>My observation is that people are afraid to break the box. But that’s the whole idea, isn’t it? You’re supposed to break the box. Because by definition, an outside-the-box solution has to be bigger than the inside of the old box.</p>
<p>But that’s okay. Making bigger boxes is the easy part. So dear friends, Break the box!</p>

    <p>Last year I had to spend 5 days in the hospital because of a very difficult wisdom tooth. And ever since I’ve had a recurring dream where I’m lost in the hospital and I can’t find my way out. When I finally find an exit, my doctor is guarding the door and won’t let me leave.</p>
<p>Strange dream. I don’t like hospitals and I usually hate doctors, but this doctor is different. I like him. I trust him. I’m not afraid of him, but for some reason I always wake up when he touches my hand.</p>
<p>Then I realize that he sent me home. And even though I'm happy to be back in my own bed, I want to know what's behind the door that he was guarding. Why did I wake up when he touched my hand? I want him to escort me through the door. But so far it's always the same dream...</p>

    <p>Is there a word for the place that stores the souls/people that will be born?  I know this is a weird question. But I hear children talk about this place all the time.  They would ask, “Mommy, where was I before I was in your tummy?” And then they are really confused when their parents tell them that they were not in existence yet.</p>
<p>I’ve pondered this question and haven’t found an answer. Religion offers no clue as to where souls or people are kept before conception. It only talks about death. But if there’s a place for people who are no longer alive... Shouldn’t there also be a place for people or souls who are not yet born?</p>
<p>I think the children are right! Where is this place? What is this place? And why don’t we know about it?</p>

    <p>It’s 44 days until the end of Winter and I’m really looking forward to Spring. Getting through Winter has always been a struggle for me due to the lack of sunlight where I live. I haven’t figured out a solid working solution yet. I take vitamin D supplements, but it really doesn’t change my mood. In the Winter I tend to feel more sad, depressed, and lonely compared to the other seasons. And I generally feel physically unwell. I know that, for me, my body and mind is directly connected with sunlight. On sunny Winter days I feel a lot better, but they are unfortunately few.</p>
<p>44 days is still a lot of days to go, so I try to keep my mind busy, my body fit, and self-soothe with comforting foods and happy music.</p>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>We all need financial security and enough money for the basics and a little bit more. But, my definition of luxury includes things that can’t be bought with money. In my opinion if you can buy it with money, it’s not real luxury. Again, I’m not saying that financial security isn’t important.</p>
<p>I'm saying that you don’t have to envy your neighbour’s electric Porsche. If you look at the Porsche in terms practicality and need, you might notice that you don’t even want or need an electric Porsche at all. And if take it a step further and imagine yourself owning it, you might feel just a little bit ridiculous. Because it’s just an expensive status symbol!</p>
<p>Now count all the things that you actually have that are, in my opinion, real luxury:
Family, friends, healthy children, love, peace, safety, a sense of accomplishment, a healthy mind and body, happiness, a purpose, knowing that you’re not alone, and a fulfilling occupation.</p>
<p>If you have two or more of the luxuries on my list, then you are indeed very rich! Don’t waste your time chasing an overabundance of money just to buy unimportant things. Spend your precious time creating happy memories instead.</p>

    <p>A new day! The sun is shining and I’m feeling a lot better. Today is Saturday and I’ll spend a good amount of time reading “Think Java, how to think like a Computer Scientist” by Allen B. Downey &amp; Chris Mayfield.
I’m already on chapter 6 and I’ve done the exercises to this point. I was really disappointed that there are no answers to the questions in the back of the book, but it really forces me to be resourceful and that’s an important part of learning Java as well.
I do recommend this book. It’s written so a child can understand it. And the exercises are actually quite fun and challenging.
It will take me a few weeks to work through the rest of the book and I’m really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Today, I will also stop by Amigoscode on YouTube and listen to his tutorials. Check him out if you’re interested in coding. His channel has a lot of good content.</p>

    <p>I’m vaccinated for Covid with Biontech. They tell me that I need a booster. Okay, I’m willing to get a booster shot with Biontech because that’s what I was vaccinated with. But now they’re telling me that I can’t have Biontech because I’m over 30; they don’t have enough and Moderna is just as good.</p>
<p>No, I don’t want Moderna. And if Moderna was just as good as Biontech they would have no problem at all giving it to people under 30 years old.</p>
<p>I would even offer to pay for the Biontech booster, but I don’t think that’s an option.</p>
<p>So, I guess I’m taking my chances with Omicron. I refuse to get vaccinated with an inferior vaccine just because there isn’t enough of the good stuff.</p>
<p>This whole situation just feels wrong.</p>
<p>Update:  31-12-2021</p>
<p>Today I was vaccinated with Biontech! Apparently, the rule is not set in stone. I went to the vaccination center and the Doctor just asked people what they wanted. Easy peasy, no fuss. So, if you’re over 30 and they refuse to give you Biontech I would recommend that you just go somewhere else.</p>

    <p>Coding is exactly like learning a language and since I speak 4 languages, I’m hoping to polish my coding skills quickly. Trial and error is key. Practice. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Sometimes you might even want to make mistakes on purpose just to see what errors you will get.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the task</li>
<li>Start with what you know in Main</li>
<li>Debug as you go along</li>
<li>Build your code little by little</li>
<li>Document your code</li>
</ul>
<p>Coding is also like writing a story. Other programmers should be able to look at your code and know what you are trying to do. Practice the jargon so you can communicate concisely with other programmers. Towards the end of the initial learning phase, coding will become more and more a team effort and communication will be essential.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time I threw up from fruit, but I don’t think it’s an allergy. You see, I’ve noticed that if I eat fruit first (and have nothing else) it stays in my tummy. I don’t get sick.  But if I eat fruit after a meal, it will make me throw up.</p>
<p>The fruits that have made me throw up include: mangos, bananas, pears, and grapes. Apparently, I can eat these fruits individually but not together with other foods.</p>

    <span class="blogDate">12/9/2021</span>

    <p>Gift Giving</p>
<p>I love giving gifts! And the gift giving season is indeed upon us. If I give you a gift it’s because I love you, or I want to say thank you, or both. You will know why. 😉</p>
<p>But as much as I love giving gifts, I’m also very cautious about doing so. The whole gift giving process can get a little political. For example, what is an expensive gift? What is a cheap gift?
I think you know where I’m going with this post. What’s expensive for one person, may not be expensive for the other. And you might not share my opinion about what’s cheap. As a rule, if you are not close friends, a gift should fall in between expensive and cheap. But that can be a little tricky.</p>
<p>For example, good perfume is always expensive. But I could never give an adult cheap perfume. I’d rather not give anything at all. The same concept goes for jewelry. I mean, why would I give someone that I like something that will turn their hand green? I won’t!  So, what do I do? If I’m not allowed to give a person an expensive gift, then I stay away from perfume and jewelry.</p>
<p>Giving someone a ridiculously cheap gift is always a big NO for me. But there are many times when giving expensive gifts is inappropriate. For example, giving an expensive gift to your child’s teacher… BIG NO for obvious reasons. Also, giving expensive gifts to those who might feel obligated to give you a gift in return is a no.</p>
<p>With all this said, here is a list of gifts that I like to give:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebooks or journals</li>
<li>Scarfs and gloves</li>
<li>Chocolates</li>
<li>A nice pen</li>
<li>Unisex beaded bracelets</li>
<li>Homemade jar of cookies</li>
<li>Gift baskets: Food or Cosmetics</li>
<li>Bath bombs or salts</li>
<li>A nice silver brooch (for women)</li>
<li>Silver cufflinks or tie pins (for men)</li>
<li>Blankets</li>
<li>Fancy coffees and Teas</li>
<li>Coffee or tea mugs</li>
</ul>
<p>Gifts that I love getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugs and Kisses 🥰</li>
<li>Compliments (Yes, please flatter me) 😅</li>
<li>Chocolates</li>
<li>Socks (Because I always have holes in mine)</li>
<li>Home-baked goods</li>
<li>Keepsakes (like Christmas ornaments)</li>
<li>Gift baskets</li>
<li>Plants and flowers</li>

    <p>I made these ascii hugs and kisses Christmas trees and would like to share them with you.
Just copy and paste. If the tree doesn’t paste completely in alignment you will have to
adjust the spacing. Works really well in g-mail and looks amazing if you add color. So
if you're tired of using the same old emojis give this a go. Tis the Season!</p>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Happy Thanksgiving to all of you who celebrate it. I live in Europe so today’s just a normal workday for me. When I lived in the United States my Caribbean family celebrated with traditional Caribbean food.</p>
<p>My mother used to get all her ingredients from a little Asian shop on Old World 3rd Street. The shop owner, a sweet little ancient and wise man, always had everything we needed. He even had canned ackee and Cock flavored soup mix. And for those of you who don’t know, stop laughing, it’s not what you think. Just google it!</p>
<p>Anywho, don’t forget to be thankful and create lots of good memories. Try to enjoy the little annoyances because someday you’ll look back and realize that these were the good ole days.</p>
<p>Be the sunshine. 🦃  Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/back-to-blogging/">Back to Blogging</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">11/15/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>A lot of people have left social media and I’m one of them. In my opinion social media is doing more harm than good. I’ve been social media free for about 3 years and it was the best decision for my mental health and productivity. I kept Youtube for watching videos, but that’s it.</p>
<p>It has been quite a while since I’ve had a blog and now that I’m not on social media anymore I realize that I miss it. This will be my little corner on the internet where I journal my journey through life without oversharing, without likes, without followers and without fake friends. There will be no stalking and no nonsense here!</p>
<p>At this point in my life I find myself going back to coding. And this is where I will chart my progress, writing down what I’ve learned and how I’ve learned it because it might be helpful to someone else. This is also where I will post holiday greetings and spread sunshine.</p>
<p>More sunshine, more flowers, more power! You’re welcome to stay a while and vibe with me.</p>
