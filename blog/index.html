<div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/me-and-fruit/">My unusual relationship with fruit</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/17/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Yesterday, after dinner, I ate a tiny piece of mango and then immediately threw up. There was nothing wrong with the mongo. I shared the mango with my family and none of them got sick.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt the first time I threw up from fruit, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an allergy. You see, I‚Äôve noticed that if I eat fruit first (and have nothing else) it stays in my tummy. I don‚Äôt get sick.  But if I eat fruit after a meal, it will make me throw up.</p>
<p>The fruits that have made me throw up include: mangos, bananas, pears, and grapes. Apparently, I can eat these fruits individually but not together with other foods.</p>
<p>Isn‚Äôt that the strangest thing? Has anyone else experienced this with fruit? I didn‚Äôt think that such a small piece of mango would make me throw up, but I was wrong!</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/pressing-on/">Pressing on</a></h2>

    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Pressing On</p>
<p>I find myself in the uncomfortable situation of having no plans for the future. I had a plan, at least I thought I had a plan. And then someone told me that even if I reach my goal, I would still have to do X-Y-Z to move forward.</p>
<p>The discouragement was devastating. I stopped and did nothing at all.  The only thing that I accomplished this year was getting my bad wisdom tooth removed. It was a horrible experience. I somehow ended up in the heart station of the hospital because I had trouble waking up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish that I hadn‚Äôt. Then at least I wouldn‚Äôt have to figure out what to do with my life. ~ <em>Deep Breath</em> ~  I have no choice but to press on. Without encouragement. Without support. Hoping that somehow, I‚Äôll be okay.</p>
<p>And you know, I think I will be. I don‚Äôt break so easily.  It‚Äôs time to move forward. If no one believes in you, you have to believe in yourself. And on my journey, I will be a source of encouragement and sunshine for others. üåûüåª</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/just-ask/">Just Ask</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/9/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I‚Äôm curious why 9 people clicked on the same story? I wrote ‚ÄúThe Lucky Card‚Äù in 2006, so it‚Äôs kind of weird that so many people are interested in the story now.</p>
<p>I got the idea for that story because several people told me that I‚Äôm a good luck charm. They were convinced that good things happen to them when I‚Äôm standing nearby. Funny, right?</p>
<p>Anywho, if you have questions please ask. My e-mail address is on the landing page. I usually answer my messages in a timely and friendly manner.</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/gift-giving/">Gift giving</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/9/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Gift Giving</p>
<p>I love giving gifts! And the gift giving season is indeed upon us. If I give you a gift it‚Äôs because I love you, or I want to say thank you, or both. You will know why. üòâ</p>
<p>But as much as I love giving gifts, I‚Äôm also very cautious about doing so. The whole gift giving process can get a little political. For example, what is an expensive gift? What is a cheap gift?
I think you know where I‚Äôm going with this post. What‚Äôs expensive for one person, may not be expensive for the other. And you might not share my opinion about what‚Äôs cheap. As a rule, if you are not close friends, a gift should fall in between expensive and cheap. But that can be a little tricky.</p>
<p>For example, good perfume is always expensive. But I could never give an adult cheap perfume. I‚Äôd rather not give anything at all. The same concept goes for jewelry. I mean, why would I give someone that I like something that will turn their hand green? I won‚Äôt!  So, what do I do? If I‚Äôm not allowed to give a person an expensive gift, then I stay away from perfume and jewelry.</p>
<p>Giving someone a ridiculously cheap gift is always a big NO for me. But there are many times when giving expensive gifts is inappropriate. For example, giving an expensive gift to your child‚Äôs teacher‚Ä¶ BIG NO for obvious reasons. Also, giving expensive gifts to those who might feel obligated to give you a gift in return is a no.</p>
<p>With all this said, here is a list of gifts that I like to give:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notebooks or journals</li>
<li>Scarfs and gloves</li>
<li>Chocolates</li>
<li>A nice pen</li>
<li>Unisex beaded bracelets</li>
<li>Homemade jar of cookies</li>
<li>Gift baskets: Food or Cosmetics</li>
<li>Bath bombs or salts</li>
<li>A nice silver brooch (for women)</li>
<li>Silver cufflinks or tie pins (for men)</li>
<li>Blankets</li>
<li>Fancy coffees and Teas</li>
<li>Coffee or tea mugs</li>
</ul>
<p>Gifts that I love getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugs and Kisses ü•∞</li>
<li>Compliments (Yes, please flatter me) üòÖ</li>
<li>Chocolates</li>
<li>Socks (Because I always have holes in mine)</li>
<li>Home-baked goods</li>
<li>Keepsakes (like Christmas ornaments)</li>
<li>Gift baskets</li>
<li>Plants and flowers</li>
</ul>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/new-years-resolution/">My New Year&#39;s Resolution</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/7/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I spend so much time chasing unattainable rainbows that I‚Äôve been missing out on enjoying the stars that I‚Äôve caught. I usually don‚Äôt make new year‚Äôs resolutions but this year I‚Äôll make an exception.  So here goes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm officially declaring my New Year‚Äôs resolution:</p>
<p>I will make my best effort to spend more time in the moment, appreciating and enjoying what I have.</p>
<p>Now that it is written, it shall be done! üòÇ</p>
<p>I‚Äôll still be chasing rainbows and butterflies, because that‚Äôs who I am. But if I can spend more time in the moment and less time chasing, I‚Äôve already won.</p>
<p>Do you have a New Year‚Äôs resolution?</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/happy-st-nicks-day/">Happy St. Nick&#39;s Day!</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">12/6/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>In my family St. Nick‚Äôs Day is special. And I would like to extend my cheer to all of you. May your hearts be filled with joy and warmth during this cold winter season.</p>
<p>I know that the holidays can be sad, stressful, and difficult. If you‚Äôre having a hard time right now just remember:</p>
<p>Everything passes</p>
<p>Keep breathing</p>
<p>Someone loves you (and you might not even know it)</p>
<p>You‚Äôre made of stardust!</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/hugs-kisses-christmastree/">Hugs and Kisses Christmas Tree</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">11/26/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>I made these ascii hugs and kisses Christmas trees and would like to share them with you.
Just copy and paste. If the tree doesn‚Äôt paste completely in alignment you will have to
adjust the spacing. Works really well in g-mail and looks amazing if you add color. So
if you're tired of using the same old emojis give this a go. Tis the Season!</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/happy-thanksgiving/">Happy Thanksgiving</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">11/25/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>Happy Thanksgiving to all of you who celebrate it. I live in Europe so today‚Äôs just a normal workday for me. When I lived in the United States my Caribbean family celebrated with traditional Caribbean food.</p>
<p>My mother used to get all her ingredients from a little Asian shop on Old World 3rd Street. The shop owner, a sweet little ancient and wise man, always had everything we needed. He even had canned ackee and Cock flavored soup mix. And for those of you who don‚Äôt know, stop laughing, it‚Äôs not what you think. Just google it!</p>
<p>Anywho, don‚Äôt forget to be thankful and create lots of good memories. Try to enjoy the little annoyances because someday you‚Äôll look back and realize that these were the good ole days.</p>
<p>Be the sunshine. ü¶É  Happy Thanksgiving! ü¶É</p>

    </div><h2 class="blogTitle"><a href="/blog/back-to-blogging/">Back to Blogging</a></h2>
    <span class="blogDate">11/15/2021</span>
    <div class="blogContent">
    
    <p>A lot of people have left social media and I‚Äôm one of them. In my opinion social media is doing more harm than good. I‚Äôve been social media free for about 3 years and it was the best decision for my mental health and productivity. I kept Youtube for watching videos, but that‚Äôs it.</p>
<p>It has been quite a while since I‚Äôve had a blog and now that I‚Äôm not on social media anymore I realize that I miss it. This will be my little corner on the internet where I journal my journey through life without oversharing, without likes, without followers and without fake friends. There will be no stalking and no nonsense here!</p>
<p>At this point in my life I find myself going back to coding. And this is where I will chart my progress, writing down what I‚Äôve learned and how I‚Äôve learned it because it might be helpful to someone else. This is also where I will post holiday greetings and spread sunshine.</p>
<p>More sunshine, more flowers, more power! You‚Äôre welcome to stay a while and vibe with me.</p>
